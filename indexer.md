# Using the "Indexer" Gem for AsciiDoctor Files

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the "Indexer" Gemini Gem to generate a list of potential index terms from an AsciiDoctor (`.adoc`) file.

---

## Step 1: Create the "Indexer" Gem

First, you need to create the custom Gem in your Gemini account. This is a one-time setup.

1.  Navigate to Gemini and find the option to create a new Gem (often found under "Explore Gems" or a similar menu).
2.  Name the new Gem **`Indexer`**.
3.  For the "Instructions" or "Prompt" section of the Gem, copy and paste the entire contents of your `indexer-prompt.txt` file.
4.  Save the Gem.

## Step 2: Prepare and Upload Your Chapter

Before you can use the Gem, you need to prepare your AsciiDoctor file for upload.

1.  Locate the `.adoc` file for the chapter you want to index.
2.  **Important**: Create a copy of the file and change its extension from `.adoc` to `.txt`. Gemini currently only allows uploading of common text file formats like `.txt`.
    * For example, rename `chapter-01.adoc` to `chapter-01.txt`.

## Step 3: Generate the Index Terms

Now you can use your new Gem to process the chapter.

1.  Select the **"Indexer"** Gem from your list of Gems in Gemini.
2.  Upload the `.txt` version of your chapter file (e.g., `chapter-01.txt`).
3.  Run the Gem. It will process the text and generate a list of suggested index terms based on the instructions you provided.

## Step 4: Save and Review the Results

The output from the Gem needs to be saved and checked.

1.  Copy the entire list of terms generated by the Gem.
2.  Paste this list into a new, plain text file.
3.  Save this file with a descriptive name, for example, `index-terms.txt`.
4.  **Review the file for plausibility.** Manually check the list to remove any irrelevant terms, correct errors, or add any terms the Gem may have missed.

## Step 5: Run the Final Script

Once you have a clean list of terms, you can use the provided shell script to process them.

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory containing your files.
3.  Execute the `indexer.sh` script, providing the **original `.adoc` file** and your new **word list file** as arguments.

```bash
# Example command:
./indexer.sh chapter-01.adoc index-terms.txt
```

This will complete the indexing process.
