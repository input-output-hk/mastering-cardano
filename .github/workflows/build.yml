    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:

      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Sets up Ruby and Bundler, then installs your dependencies from Gemfile.lock
      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.4.4' # Or any other recent version

        run: make all

      # 6. Uploads the generated files from the 'dist' directory as a build artifact.
