== Learn About Cardano

=== What is Cardano?
Cardano is a *third-generation*, *open-source*, *proof-of-stake* blockchain platform designed to provide a secure, scalable, and interoperable infrastructure for developing smart contracts(((smart contract))) and decentralized applications (DApps). Its primary goal is to address the limitations of earlier blockchain platforms by prioritizing these core tenets. As a fully https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/blockchain/edi[decentralized] network, Cardano supports a diverse range of applications, from financial services to supply chain management. Recent advancements, including the https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2024/08/30/chang-upgrade-a-big-step-in-changing-the-world-with-cardano/[Chang] and https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/plomin-hard-fork-ratified[Plomin] hard forks(((hard fork))), have further enhanced its decentralization, establishing it as a leading decentralized blockchain.

Cardano boasts a https://cardanoupdates.com/[thriving ecosystem] of builders, developers, content creators, and educators, supported by a wide array of tools and explorers. To learn more about this vibrant community, explore the https://www.cardanocube.com/cardano-ecosystem-interactive-map[ecosystem map], the https://www.essentialcardano.io/[Essential Cardano website], and the https://github.com/IntersectMBO/essential-cardano[Essential Cardano list].

=== Who built Cardano?
The Cardano project began in 2015 and is based on *peer-reviewed research* and developed through *evidence-based methods*. It was built by leading scientists, expert developers, and the extended team at https://iohk.io/[Input | Output (IO)] (initially IOHK), under the leadership of https://iohk.io/en/leadership/charles-hoskinson[Charles Hoskinson]. IO is a renowned blockchain infrastructure research and engineering company with a global presence, fostering a focused innovation ecosystem.

The project is pioneered by https://iohk.io/[IO], the https://www.cardanofoundation.org/[Cardano Foundation], https://www.emurgo.io/[Emurgo], and other third parties. The platform is named after https://www.britannica.com/biography/Girolamo-Cardano[Girolamo Cardano], a 16th-century Italian physician and mathematician, while its native cryptocurrency, ada(((ADA))), honors https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ada-Lovelace[Ada Lovelace], the 19th-century English mathematician credited with publishing the first computer program.

Cardano's development adheres to an *evidence-based engineering approach*, applying formal logic to the software development cycle. This rigorous process, starting with published research papers and progressing to formal specifications and reference implementations, ensures correctness, safety, and code reliability. Prof. Aggelos Kiayias(((Kiayias, Aggelos))), chief scientist at IO, states:
_‘When you go about designing a system, you have to present the system in the context of the research domain in which it belongs, why the system has the benefits it claims to have, and what exactly is the problem that the system is solving. There are a lot of benefits in taking such a first principles approach.’_

=== Core principles of Cardano

==== Mission and open-source ethos
Cardano's core mission, as a fully decentralized platform, is to improve global systems to enable economic inclusion and empowerment for all. Charles Hoskinson articulated this in 2020, stating:
_‘Cardano is an open platform that seeks to provide economic identity to the billions who lack it by providing decentralized applications to manage identity, value, and governance.’_

At its heart, Cardano is a thriving *open-source project* with a healthy and vibrant ecosystem of active developers and builders. This commitment to open-source principles fosters *collaboration and transparency* with the community, leading to a robust and inclusive environment for users and developers. All over two hundred https://iohk.io/en/research/library/[research papers] and technical specifications underpinning Cardano are publicly available, and all development activity is published online with weekly updates for transparency.

==== Decentralization and proof-of-stake consensus
Cardano achieves full *decentralization* through over 3,000 community-operated *stake pools*. Over 1.3 million wallets delegate their ada to these pools, representing approximately 64% of the total active ada supply. Network participants validate all blocks and transactions without reliance on a centralized authority, sharing decisions and ownership of information amongst all users. Every ada holder holds a stake in the network, allowing them to delegate their ada to a stake pool to earn rewards and participate in network operations. Stake pool operators can also pledge ada to increase their pool's likelihood of receiving rewards.

Cardano utilizes https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/23/the-ouroboros-path-to-decentralization[Ouroboros], a *proof-of-stake (PoS)* consensus protocol. Ouroboros has been rigorously proven to provide the same security guarantees as proof-of-work protocols, while being significantly more *energy-efficient*. You can learn more about Ouroboros in the dedicated chapter.

Cardano extends Bitcoin's UTXO model with an *extended UTXO (EUTXO) accounting model*, which enables smart contracts. For more details on EUTXO, refer to the relevant chapter.

==== Seamless upgrades

One of the features of Cardano is seamless upgrades. Traditionally, blockchains upgrade using hard forks(((hard fork))). When conducting a hard fork, the current protocol would stop operating, new rules and changes would be implemented, and the chain would restart. Cardano handles hard forks(((hard fork))) differently. Instead of implementing radical changes, the Cardano hard fork combinator technology ensures a smooth transition to a new protocol while saving the history of the previous blocks and not causing any disruptions for end users.

=== Core pillars: security, scalability, and interoperability

As a third-generation blockchain, Cardano combines the strengths of earlier generations like Bitcoin and Ethereum, built on the fundamental principles of security, scalability, and interoperability. These three core pillars have defined the design rationale of Cardano, as follows:

- *Security*: Cardano is developed using *formal methods*, which involve mathematical specifications and proofs to guarantee the functional correctness of its core components, providing the highest level of assurance for digital fund management. The Cardano node is primarily written in *Haskell*, a secure functional programming language that promotes building systems with pure functions, leading to isolated and testable components. Haskell's advanced features enable rigorous code correctness checks, including formal and executable specifications, extensive property-based testing, and simulation. The Ouroboros protocol further establishes rigorous security guarantees, backed by numerous peer-reviewed papers presented at top-tier conferences in cybersecurity and cryptography.

- *Scalability*: The Cardano network is designed to *scale with user demand*, processing an increasing number of transactions and enhancing network bandwidth to manage significant supportive data efficiently. Cardano employs techniques like data compression and offers Hydra, a Layer 2 scalability solution. It also uses input endorsers to improve block propagation times and throughput, supporting higher transaction rates.

- *Interoperability*: This is a fundamental design feature, enabling interaction with other systems. A key innovation is *partner chain support*, facilitating asset transfers between parallel blockchains with different rules, mechanisms, languages, or network utilization methods. Work is ongoing to support cross-chain transfers, multiple token types, and commonly used smart contract languages, with the *partner chains toolkit* marking the initial step.

==== Sustainability and governance
*Governance* is central to Cardano's design, ensuring system sustainability and adaptability. A well-developed governance strategy promotes effective, democratic funding for long-term development and organic growth in a decentralized manner. Decentralized governance empowers all users with a voice and control over the protocol’s future.

As Charles Hoskinson stated:
_‘Governance is not optional. No matter who you are, what you do, when you create something that other people use, the first question is how do we upgrade, maintain, and change it to meet our needs?’_

Cardano’s governance model reflects a *liquid and representative democracy*. Through individual participation and immutable vote recording, ada(((ADA))) holders can decide on the distribution of treasury(((treasury))) funds and the platform's future development.

Designing a proof-of-stake blockchain necessitates self-sustainability. *Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs)* foster and formalize discussions around new features and development within the community. The Cardano governance(((governance))) https://www.intersectmbo.org/roadmap[roadmap], particularly under *CIP-1694*, guides the community through a structured transition to a decentralized, community-driven governance model, allowing for extensive community feedback and refinement.

https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/cardano-cip-1694-explained[CIP-1694], named after Voltaire's birth year, was community-written to discuss the future of on-chain governance. It aims to give everyone a voice in Cardano's direction by advancing the current governance system. The proposal outlines a trilateral model consisting of stake pool operators (stake pool operator), delegate representatives (DReps), and a constitutional committee (CC), each with distinct responsibilities.

Central to the treasury(((treasury))) is a *democratized voting mechanism* where ada(((ada))) holders decide fund allocation by voting on proposals. This ensures democratic decision-making for funding initiatives, protocol updates, and constitutional changes.

Launched in 2023, https://www.intersectmbo.org/[Intersect] is a member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem, placing the community at the core of Cardano’s future development.

==== Advantages of Cardano

Cardano's unique strengths stem from its foundational design principles:

- *Academic research & formal methods*(((formal methods))): Cardano is built using formal methods, including mathematical specifications, property-based tests, and proofs, which ensure high assurance for software systems and security for digital funds. All underlying research and technical specifications are publicly available, and development activity is transparently published online.

- *System design (Haskell)*: The Cardano node is primarily written in *Haskell*, a secure functional programming language(((functional programming language))) that encourages building a system using pure functions, which leads to a design where components are conveniently testable in isolation. Advanced features of Haskell(((Haskell))) enable employing a whole range of powerful methods for ensuring code correctness, such as basing the implementation on formal and executable specifications, extensive property-based testing, and running tests in simulation.

- *Security (Ouroboros)*(((Ouroboros))): *Ouroboros* (the Cardano proof-of-stake protocol) establishes rigorous *security guarantees*; it was delivered with several peer-reviewed papers presented in top-tier conferences and publications in the area of cybersecurity and cryptography.

- *Energy efficiency*: As a proof-of-stake blockchain, Cardano is significantly more energy-efficient and requires less computational power than proof-of-work systems, like Bitcoin, which consume substantial electricity.

- *Seamless upgrades*: Cardano's *hard fork combinator technology* enables smooth protocol transitions, preserving historical data and preventing disruptions for end-users.

- *Decentralization*: Maintained by over 3,000 community-operated stake pools, Cardano is fully decentralized, with all blocks and transactions validated by network participants without central authority.

- *Functional environment for business use cases*: Cardano provides a foundation for global, decentralized finance, supporting a range of DApps with functional and domain-specific smart contracts and multi-asset tokens.

=== Cardano community and ecosystem growth
Cardano benefits from a vibrant and thriving ecosystem that promotes active engagement with builders, developers, content creators, and users. The Cardano ecosystem is a dynamic and rapidly-growing collection of projects, organizations, creators, and builders who are working together to improve and develop the platform even further.

As a community-driven ecosystem, there is a strong focus on innovation, collaboration, and cooperation between innovators, smart contract developers, content creators, and distributed application (DApp) developers that build on Cardano. The aim is to grow the contributor ecosystem even more each year.

Key resources for the Cardano ecosystem include:

- *https://www.cardanocube.com/cardano-ecosystem-interactive-map[Cardano Cube Interactive Map]*: Explore the diverse landscape of current projects.
- *https://www.essentialcardano.io/[Essential Cardano Website]*: A central community resource for understanding Cardano, its partners, mission, roadmap, and building on the platform. This evolved from the original Essential Cardano List repository created in 2021.
- *https://developers.cardano.org/tools/[Builder Tools] and https://www.essentialcardano.io/community[Community Channels]*: Various resources are available to navigate the ecosystem.

==== Cardano improvement proposals (CIPs)
The https://cips.cardano.org/[Cardano Improvement Proposal] (CIP) process is a structured, community-led mechanism for suggesting and implementing changes and improvements. It ensures transparency and collaboration, allowing the community to shape Cardano's future. Anyone can submit a CIP, covering technical or non-technical suggestions. After adhering to guidelines and review by CIP editors, proposals are opened for community discussion, refinement, and eventual implementation on-chain. All CIPs are documented in the CIP repository, forming an audit trail of historical changes.

==== Cardano Ambassador program
The https://cardano.org/ambassadors/[Cardano Ambassador program] aims to increase awareness and adoption, fostering relationships and expanding the community. Ambassadors, from diverse backgrounds globally, work diligently as content creators, translators, moderators, and educators to strengthen relationships and educate new members.

=== Educating the world about Cardano
Education is a gateway for adoption and has always been an integral part of the strategy of Cardano’s pioneering members: https://iohk.io/[Input | Output], the https://cardanofoundation.org/[Cardano Foundation], and https://www.emurgo.io/[Emurgo]. It plays a transformative role in fostering a knowledgeable and engaged global community by equipping them with the expertise, skills, confidence, and opportunities to deepen their understanding and successfully build on Cardano and thrive in the ecosystem.

Education is a gift that empowers and enhances Cardano community members through access to knowledge and experience so that they can overcome the complexity of blockchain technology. Pioneering worldwide education on blockchain offers the opportunity to shape the field for generations and leave a lasting legacy.

Cardano's educational offerings cater to developers, academics, and business professionals, equipping them with necessary skills and knowledge.

==== Input | Output education
The IO education team possesses extensive experience in curriculum design, project management, blockchain technology, Haskell, Cardano expertise, and smart contract languages like Plutus, Aiken, and Marlowe. This ensures comprehensive and practical programs for diverse learners. The team aims to enhance understanding of Cardano technologies for various audiences, including enterprise decision-makers, and to foster a supportive learning environment. IO is committed to improving developer experience and smart contract adoption through education.

As Dr. Lars Brünjes(((Brünjes, Lars))), Director of Education at IO, emphasizes:

 ‘Education is a cornerstone of our approach at Cardano. By equipping individuals with the knowledge and skills to navigate and innovate within the blockchain ecosystem, we empower them to build a more decentralized and inclusive future. My greatest fulfillment came from teaching the all-female Haskell course in Ethiopia, witnessing firsthand the transformative power of education. That experience reaffirmed my belief in the potential of education to create substantive, lasting change.’

- Hackathon support: writing hackathon challenges and attending the event to support the participants.

The first Cardano developer course was delivered online in conjunction with https://www.theafricablockchaincenter.com/[the African Blockchain Center] to participants from the African region and covered the core modules of Haskell(((Haskell))) fundamentals and smart contract development languages, including Aiken(((Aiken))), Plutus(((Plutus))), and Marlowe(((Marlowe))). This course evolved from the original Haskell(((Haskell))) course and was expanded to include lectures on Aiken(((Aiken))). A further iteration of the course was delivered in person at the https://utn.edu.ar/es/[Universidad Technológica Nacional] in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

We have delivered several Pioneer Programs aimed at developers and new users. These interactive online training courses aim to widen the reach of IO’s education resources and have been completed by over nine thousand people. During these programs, participants attend weekly lectures delivered by Lars Brünjes, director of education at IO, who also held weekly follow-up interactive Q&A sessions. Learners are supported by a thriving community in the Discord chat system that encouraged collaboration and problem-solving.

One of the most positive outcomes of these courses was the amazing community participation on Discord. The participants supported each other, created additional learning resources, were quick to report any issues, and tested features – they really were acting as true pioneers. We also saw a wide range of innovative resources and ideas from the courses, including new wallets, training materials, and new projects on Cardano.

A self-paced Cardano Education Program (CEP) is currently being developed where participants will be able to pick and choose the modules they want to complete and work at their own pace, rather than follow a weekly schedule.

===== About the Cardano developer portal

The https://developers.cardano.org/[Cardano developer portal] is an additional learning resource and is part of the Cardano.org domain: a product-and-vendor neutral contact point for technical topics.

Guided by the principle of community involvement, all content is contributed openly and transparently using a GitHub process (branch, pull request, review, merge). This approach allows anyone to submit proposals with new or updated Markdown-formatted content and thus contribute actively and constructively.

Under the hood, https://docusaurus.io/[Docusaurus] (an open-source(((open-source))) project for building, deploying, and maintaining websites) works as a generator of web pages with extensive search functions.

The content of this developer portal is intended to practically demonstrate and exemplify how certain functions and operations can be implemented on Cardano, as well as showcase existing projects. A basic requirement for including projects is that they must be functioning and usable on the mainnet (see the guideline for https://developers.cardano.org/docs/portal-contribute/#add-a-project-to-showcase[adding new projects]).

This portal provides resources to https://developers.cardano.org/docs/integrate-cardano/[integrate Cardano], https://developers.cardano.org/docs/transaction-metadata/[build with transaction metadata], https://developers.cardano.org/docs/native-tokens/[explore native tokens], https://developers.cardano.org/docs/smart-contracts/[create smart contracts(((smart contract)))], https://developers.cardano.org/docs/governance/[participate in governance(((governance)))], and https://developers.cardano.org/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/[operate a stake pool].

Contributions from all individuals, including non-developers, are encouraged to foster continuous evolution by the community. Contributing to the portal can boost reputation and visibility, or serve as a good learning experience in the GitHub open-source(((open-source))) and knowledge-minded contribution process. Each contribution acts as a valuable addition to your resume, potentially leading to career opportunities within the Cardano ecosystem. Ways to contribute include spreading awareness, creating issues on GitHub or the Cardano Forum, improving the copy by fixing errors or enhancing writing, and creating explanatory graphics.
There is a dedicated section that describes https://developers.cardano.org/docs/portal-contribute/[how best to contribute].

The https://developers.cardano.org/docs/portal-contribute/[Builder Tools] section of the portal encourages the addition of valuable tools that benefit Cardano developers. Guidelines for adding tools include being an actual builder tool, having a stable domain name, and using a GitHub account with a history or presence in the Cardano community.

The documentation in the portal can always be improved, and users are encouraged to contribute by creating and enhancing tutorials. Reviewing pull requests is another way to contribute, requiring technical understanding and prior contributions. The FAQs cover topics such as the pull request review process, becoming a reviewer, getting added to the contributor list, and connecting with the developer community through Discord and the forum.
