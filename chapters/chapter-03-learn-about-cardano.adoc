== Learn About Cardano

=== What is Cardano?
Cardano is an *open-source(((open-source)))*, *proof of stake(((proof of stake)))* blockchain platform. As a third-generation platform, it combines pioneering technologies to provide a more secure and scalable infrastructure for developing smart contracts(((smart contracts))) and decentralized applications (DApps(((DApps))) ).

Cardano aims to address the shortcomings of existing blockchain platforms by focusing on security(((security))), scalability(((scalability))), and interoperability(((interoperability))). As a fully https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/blockchain/edi[decentralized] blockchain, it can support a wide range of applications, from financial services to supply chain management and beyond. With the recent implementations of the https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2024/08/30/chang-upgrade-a-big-step-in-changing-the-world-with-cardano/[Chang] and https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/plomin-hard-fork-ratified[Plomin] hard forks(((hard forks))), Cardano has become the most decentralized blockchain network in operation.

Cardano has a https://cardanoupdates.com/[thriving ecosystem] of builders, developers, content creators, and educators, as well as tools and explorers. There is a wide range of active projects and developer tools available to help you build on Cardano. If you would like to learn more about the vibrant Cardano ecosystem, see the https://www.cardanocube.com/cardano-ecosystem-interactive-map[ecosystem map(((ecosystem map)))], https://www.essentialcardano.io/[Essential Cardano(((Essential Cardano))) website], and the https://github.com/IntersectMBO/essential-cardano[Essential Cardano(((Essential Cardano))) list].

=== Who built Cardano?
The Cardano project began in 2015 and is based on *peer-reviewed research(((peer-reviewed research)))* and developed through *evidence-based methods*. It has been built by leading scientists, expert developers, and the extended team at https://iohk.io/[Input | Output (IO)(((Input | Output (IO))))] (initially IOHK), led by https://iohk.io/en/leadership/charles-hoskinson[Charles Hoskinson(((Hoskinson, Charles(((Hoskinson, Charles))))))]. Input | Output is a pre-eminent blockchain infrastructure research and engineering company with over 600 employees globally. This extends to a focused innovation ecosystem.

The Cardano project is pioneered by https://iohk.io/[IO], the https://www.cardanofoundation.org/[Cardano Foundation], https://www.emurgo.io/[Emurgo(((Emurgo)))], and other third parties. It is named after https://www.britannica.com/biography/Girolamo-Cardano[Girolamo Cardano(((Cardano, Girolamo)))], the 16th century Italian physician and mathematician and Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, ada(((ada))), is inspired by https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ada-Lovelace[Ada Lovelace(((Lovelace, Ada(((Lovelace, Ada))))))], the 19th century English mathematician and the first person ever to publish a computer program.

Cardano follows an evidence-based engineering approach by applying formal logic to the software development cycle. This ensures that thoroughly researched and rigorous designs are turned into efficient implementations, guaranteeing correctness, safety, and code reliability. This process begins with published research papers which are later converted into formal specifications that evolve into reference implementations and products.

Prof Aggelos Kiayias(((Kiayias, Aggelos))), chief scientist at IO, says:
_‘When you go about designing a system, you have to present the system in the context of the research domain in which it belongs, why the system has the benefits it claims to have, and what exactly is the problem that the system is solving. There are a lot of benefits in taking such a first principles approach.’_

=== Mission of Cardano
The core mission of Cardano, as a fully decentralized platform, is to improve the world’s systems to enable economic inclusion and empowerment for all.

Charles Hoskinson(((Hoskinson, Charles(((Hoskinson, Charles)))))) said in 2020:
_‘Cardano is an open platform that seeks to provide economic identity to the billions who lack it by providing decentralized applications to manage identity, value, and governance(((governance))).’_

=== Open source ethos
Cardano is a thriving *open-source(((open-source))) project* with a *healthy*, *vibrant ecosystem* of active developers and builders. Open-source principles are integral to Cardano’s identity as a decentralized blockchain platform. Collaboration and transparency with the Cardano community result in a robust and inclusive ecosystem that empowers users and developers alike.

All https://iohk.io/en/research/library/[research papers] and technical specifications that underpin Cardano, totaling over two hundred, are publicly available. The codebase is open, and all Cardano development activity is published online with weekly development updates for transparency.

=== Decentralization
Cardano is maintained by over 3,000 community-operated stake pools(((stake pools))), ensuring full decentralization(((decentralization))). Over 1.3 million wallets delegate to these stake pools(((stake pools))),  representing approximately 64% of the total active ada(((ada))) supply. Network participants validate all blocks and transactions without any reliance on a centralized authority. Decisions and ownership of information are shared amongst all users.

Every ada(((ada))) holder also holds a stake in the Cardano network -- ada(((ada))) stored in a wallet can be delegated to a stake pool to earn rewards and participate in the network’s successful operation. Stake pool operators can also pledge some ada(((ada))) to their stake pool to increase its likelihood of receiving rewards.

=== Reaching consensus using proof of stake(((proof of stake)))
Cardano uses proof of stake(((proof of stake))) to reach a consensus. Fundamentally, Cardano has been built as a resilient and sustainable blockchain with a proof-of-stake consensus protocol called https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/23/the-ouroboros-path-to-decentralization(((decentralization)))/[Ouroboros(((Ouroboros)))], which has been proven to have the same security(((security))) guarantees as proof-of-work protocols and is undoubtedly more https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/comparison-of-energy-consumption-of-cardano-and-bitcoin[energy efficient]. To learn more about Ouroboros(((Ouroboros))), read the #<x ref to Ouroboros(((Ouroboros))) chapter>#.

Cardano builds upon Bitcoin(((Bitcoin)))’s UTXO(((UTXO))) model and implements an extended UTXO(((UTXO))) (EUTXO) accounting model that supports smart contracts(((smart contracts))). To learn more about EUTXO, read the #<ETXO chapter x-ref>#.

One of the features of Cardano is seamless upgrades. Traditionally, blockchains upgrade using hard forks(((hard forks))). When conducting a hard fork, the current protocol would stop operating, new rules and changes would be implemented, and the chain would restart. Cardano handles hard forks(((hard forks))) differently. Instead of implementing radical changes, the Cardano hard fork combinator technology ensures a smooth transition to a new protocol while saving the history of the previous blocks and not causing any disruptions for end users.

=== Core pillars of Cardano
As a third-generation blockchain, Cardano combines the properties of previous generations like Bitcoin(((Bitcoin))) and Ethereum. It has been built as a resilient and sustainable platform using the core principles of security(((security))), scalability(((scalability))), and interoperability(((interoperability))).

Let’s learn more about these core pillars of Cardano.

==== Security
Cardano has been built using formal methods(((formal methods))), which guarantees the functional correctness of its core components. These methods include producing mathematical specifications and proofs, which provide the highest level of assurance for software systems and give confidence to users managing their digital funds.

The Cardano node is primarily written in Haskell(((Haskell))), a secure functional programming language(((functional programming language))) that encourages building a system using pure functions. This leads to a design where components are conveniently testable in isolation. Furthermore, Haskell(((Haskell)))’s advanced features allow for a range of powerful methods for ensuring code correctness, such as implementing formal and executable specifications, extensive property-based testing, and running tests in simulation.

Ouroboros(((Ouroboros))) (the Cardano proof-of-stake protocol) establishes rigorous security(((security))) guarantees. It was delivered with several peer-reviewed papers presented at top-tier conferences and publications in the area of cybersecurity and cryptography.
Scalability
The Cardano network is designed to scale as user demand grows, allowing it to process a growing number of transactions. Scalability enhances the network’s bandwidth,  enabling transactions to carry a significant amount of supportive data that can be efficiently managed. For these needs, Cardano employs various techniques like data compression and offers a layer 2 scalability(((scalability))) solution – https://hydra.family/head-protocol/[Hydra(((Hydra)))].

Cardano also uses input endorsers to improve block propagation times and throughput. This improves the consistency of block propagation times and supports higher transaction rates.

==== Interoperability
Interoperability, the ability to interact with other systems, is a fundamental design feature of Cardano. One of Cardano’s key innovations is partner chain support(((partner chain support))), which enables the transfer of assets between parallel blockchains operating under different rules, mechanisms, languages, or network utilization methods.

Work is ongoing to support cross-chain transfers, multiple token types, and commonly used smart contract languages. The https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2024/08/01/announcing-the-alpha-v1-release-of-the-partner-chains-toolkit/[partner chains toolkit(((partner chains toolkit)))] marks the first step in this journey.

==== Sustainability and governance(((governance)))
Governance is central to the design of Cardano to ensure system sustainability(((sustainability))) and adaptability. A well-developed governance(((governance))) strategy enables effective, democratic funding for Cardano’s long-term development, promoting sustainability(((sustainability))) and organic growth in a decentralized manner. Decentralized governance(((governance))) and decision making are vital for providing everyone a voice and control over the protocol’s future development.

Charles Hoskinson(((Hoskinson, Charles(((Hoskinson, Charles)))))) says:
_‘Governance is not optional. No matter who you are, what you do, when you create something that other people use, the first question is how do we upgrade, maintain, and change it to meet our needs?’_

The community is central to Cardano's identity, and Cardano’s governance(((governance))) model reflects this by implementing liquid and representative democracy. Through individual participation and immutable vote recording, ada(((ada))) holders can decide on the distribution of treasury(((treasury))) funds and the platform's future development. So, as a community, how can we work together to outline policies and guidelines for the future development of Cardano and ensure that everyone has a voice?

Designing a proof-of-stake blockchain means it is vital to ensure that the system is self-sustainable. Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) are delivered to foster and formalize discussions around new features and their development within the community.

Cardano governance(((governance))) has a clear https://www.intersectmbo.org/roadmap(((roadmap)))[roadmap(((roadmap)))] guiding the community through the entire process. The stages of the Cardano governance(((governance))) roadmap(((roadmap))), particularly under CIP-1694(((CIP-1694))), reflect a structured approach to evolving Cardano's governance(((governance))) model into a decentralized, community-driven system. This roadmap(((roadmap))) facilitates a gradual transition, allowing for ample community feedback and refinement.

https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/cardano-cip-1694-explained[CIP-1694(((CIP-1694)))] was written by the community to discuss the future of on-chain governance(((governance))) for Cardano and ensure the platform's sustainability(((sustainability))). Named after the birth year of Voltaire(((Voltaire))), this CIP aims to give everyone a voice and say in the direction of Cardano by advancing the current governance(((governance))) system. It outlines a voting framework to decide on updates to the protocol, new standards for on-chain improvements, funding decisions, and governance(((governance))) of Cardano native tokens. The proposal outlines a trilateral model consisting of stake pool operators (SPOs), delegate representatives (DReps), and a constitutional committee (CC), each with distinct responsibilities and roles.

Central to the treasury(((treasury))) is a democratized voting mechanism where ada(((ada))) holders will decide how funds are allocated by voting on funding proposals. This approach ensures that decisions result from a democratic vote rather than from just a select group of stakeholders. This voting system will influence decisions such as funding initiatives, authorizing updates to the protocol, and rolling out any constitutional updates such as changes to the decision-making process, or the minting of new tokens.

Launched in 2023, https://www.intersectmbo.org/[Intersect(((Intersect)))] is a member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem and puts the community at the core of Cardano’s future development. Bringing members together behind a shared vision, Intersect(((Intersect))) enables a more resilient, secure, transparent, and innovative Cardano ecosystem that puts members in the driving seat of Cardano’s future.

=== Design rationale of Cardano
Cardano, as a third-generation blockchain, combines the properties of the prior generations and addresses previous limitations. It is the first blockchain platform to be designed from a scientific philosophy and research-first driven approach. Cardano is a decentralized and community-driven platform where the network is supported by an active community of global developers, researchers, and ada(((ada))) holders who contribute to its ongoing development and governance(((governance))).

Cardano has been built in a way that ensures the highest security(((security))), scalability(((scalability))) (transaction throughput(((transaction throughput))), data scale, network bandwidth), and functionality (transaction processing and business deal settlement). Additionally, it is important to ensure that the technology was developed with the core tenets of transparency, sustainability(((sustainability))) and the ability to be interoperable with other blockchains and financial institutions.

Cardano has been designed with security(((security))) as one of its founding principles. It is written in Haskell(((Haskell))), the functional programming language(((functional programming language))). In a functional language like Haskell(((Haskell))), building your system using pure functions is encouraged, which leads to a design where components are conveniently testable in isolation. Furthermore, advanced features of Haskell(((Haskell))) enable employing a whole range of powerful methods for ensuring the correctness of the code, such as basing the implementation on formal and executable specifications, extensive property-based testing, and running tests in simulation.

The design rationale of Cardano focuses on the following core concepts:

- Scalability – ensures that the Cardano network is capable of processing an increasing number of transactions as user demand grows. Scalability also provides higher bandwidth capabilities to allow transactions to carry a significant amount of supportive data that can be easily managed within the network. For these needs, Cardano is implementing various techniques (like data compression for instance), and introduces such scaling solutions as Hydra(((Hydra))) and Mithril(((Mithril))), for example. Read more about the research underpinning Cardano's scalability(((scalability))) here.

- Interoperability – ensures the most multi-functional environment for financial, business, or commercial operations by enabling users to interact with different blockchain systems. Cardano aims to support cross-chain transfers, multiple token types, and commonly used smart contract languages. Read more about the concept of partner chains.

- Sustainability – designing a proof-of-stake blockchain means it is vital to ensure that the system is self-sustainable. To drive growth and maturity in a truly decentralized manner, Cardano is built to allow the community to maintain its continuous development by participating, proposing, and implementing system improvements. This is now being implemented through CIP-1694(((CIP-1694))) on-chain governance(((governance))) mechanisms.

==== Advantages​ of Cardano

- Academic research – formal methods(((formal methods))), such as mathematical specifications, property-based tests, and proofs, are the best way to deliver high assurance software systems and give confidence to users for the management of digital funds. Cardano has been built using formal methods(((formal methods))) to achieve strong guarantees on the functional correctness of core components of the system. All of the research and technical specifications that underpin Cardano are publicly available, and all Cardano development activity is published online.

- System design – Cardano is written in Haskell(((Haskell))), a secure functional programming language(((functional programming language))) that encourages building a system using pure functions, which leads to a design where components are conveniently testable in isolation. Advanced features of Haskell(((Haskell))) enable employing a whole range of powerful methods for ensuring code correctness, such as basing the implementation on formal and executable specifications, extensive property-based testing, and running tests in simulation.

- Security – Ouroboros(((Ouroboros))) (the Cardano proof-of-stake protocol) establishes rigorous security(((security))) guarantees; it was delivered with several peer-reviewed papers presented in top-tier conferences and publications in the area of cybersecurity and cryptography.

- Energy efficiency – Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain. In contrast to proof-of-work blockchains, Cardano requires much less energy and computational power. The Bitcoin(((Bitcoin))) network is secured through computers doing ever-more-energy-intensive computations – proof of work(((proof of work))) – which is unsustainable in the long term. Cambridge University has an online tool that shows the computers powering Bitcoin(((Bitcoin))) already consume more electricity than some countries, like Switzerland for example.

- Seamless upgrades – traditionally, blockchains upgrade using hard forks(((hard forks))). When conducting a hard fork, the current protocol would stop operating, new rules and changes would be implemented, and the chain would restart – with its previous history being erased. Cardano handles hard forks(((hard forks))) differently. Instead of implementing radical changes, the Cardano hard fork combinator technology ensures a smooth transition to a new protocol while saving the history of the previous blocks and not causing any disruptions for end users.

- Decentralization – Cardano is maintained by over 3,000 distributed stake pools(((stake pools))) that are operated by the community. All blocks and transactions are validated by network participants without any reliance on a centralized authority.

- Functional environment for business use cases – Cardano is establishing a foundation for global, decentralized finance to develop a range of DApps(((DApps))) that can run using functional and domain-specific smart contracts(((smart contracts))), providing multi-asset tokens for any needs.

=== Cardano community and growth of the ecosystem
Cardano benefits from a vibrant and thriving ecosystem that promotes active engagement with builders, developers, content creators, and users. The Cardano ecosystem is a dynamic and rapidly-growing collection of projects, organizations, creators, and builders who are working together to improve and develop the platform even further.

As a community-driven ecosystem, there is a strong focus on innovation, collaboration, and cooperation between innovators, smart contract developers, content creators, and distributed application (DApp) developers that build on Cardano. The aim is to grow the contributor ecosystem even more each year.

==== About the Cardano ecosystem
The Cardano ecosystem spans the globe with creators and builders dotted around the world. With many years of collaboration, innovation, and progress behind it, Cardano continues to grow and develop into a vast and self-governing ecosystem.

You can take a closer look at the vibrant landscape of Cardano’s ecosystem and explore the wide range of current projects using the Cardano Cube interactive map.

Another important resource is our community platform resource Essential Cardano(((Essential Cardano))). Here you can learn more about the growing Cardano ecosystem and keep up to date with regular development updates, blogs on various topics, and learning resources.

There are a number of builder tools and various community channels available within the ecosystem to help you navigate the environment, for example:

- https://developers.cardano.org/tools/[Builder Tools]
- https://www.essentialcardano.io/community[Cardano community channels]

==== Cardano improvement proposals
The https://cips.cardano.org/[Cardano Improvement Proposal] (CIP) process is a structured process that enables ideas for change and improvement within the ecosystem. It is a community-led mechanism that  provides transparency and encourages collaboration among stakeholders, thereby enabling the community to shape the future of the Cardano ecosystem together.

Anyone can write and submit a CIP, which typically covers both technical and non-technical suggestions and changes to Cardano. These CIPs must adhere to a set of guidelines and include a description of the issue, how it can be solved, and a plan on how to implement the changes. The next stage in the process is a review by https://cips.cardano.org/contributors[CIP editors(((CIP editors)))] who ensure that it adheres to the set of guidelines, before they open it up for community discussion on whether or not it should be implemented. During this feedback cycle, the proposal is often refined and further improved, before it is moved to the implementation stage. In some cases, where there is a proposed protocol change, further governance(((governance))) is required by the founding entities.

Once a CIP is approved, it is implemented on-chain by the relevant developers and stake pool operators. In some cases, a network upgrade is needed which requires further collaboration between the various stakeholders. All CIPs are documented and maintained in the CIP repository, forming an audit trail of historical changes to Cardano.

==== Cardano Ambassador program
The https://cardano.org/ambassadors/[Cardano Ambassador program] promotes awareness, fosters relationships, and works to nurture and expand the wider community by increasing adoption. It includes a wide range of committed and hard-working individuals from all around the globe with a wide variety of age and social profiles. These ambassadors work diligently as content creators, translators, moderators, and educators to strengthen relationships, educate, and bring more people into the growing Cardano community.

=== Educating the world about Cardano
Education is a gateway for adoption and has always been an integral part of the strategy of Cardano’s pioneering members: https://iohk.io/[Input | Output], the https://cardanofoundation.org/[Cardano Foundation], and https://www.emurgo.io/[Emurgo(((Emurgo)))]. It plays a transformative role in fostering a knowledgeable and engaged global community by equipping them with the expertise, skills, confidence, and opportunities to deepen their understanding and successfully build on Cardano and thrive in the ecosystem.

Education is a gift that empowers and enhances Cardano community members through access to knowledge and experience so that they can overcome the complexity of blockchain technology. Pioneering worldwide education on blockchain offers the opportunity to shape the field for generations and leave a lasting legacy.

Whether you're a developer, an academic, or a business professional, Cardano’s educational offerings are designed to equip you with all the skills and knowledge you need.

===== Developer education

The Cardano education program (CEP) for developers consists of a set of courses that cover all aspects of Cardano. This program includes a set of courses and flexible modules that can be tailored to the needs of each audience. 

- Cardano Developer course: a blended learning course that teaches Haskell(((Haskell))) and smart contract development to aspiring blockchain developers.
- https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-course[Haskell(((Haskell))) Bootcamp]: an immersive self-paced Haskell(((Haskell))) course. This course provides a stepping stone for people to upskill on Haskell(((Haskell))) before enrolling in the Plutus(((Plutus))) Pioneer program. It consists of videos and interactive lessons and has received very positive feedback and engagement. 
- https://docs.cardano.org/pioneer-programs/plutus-pioneers[Plutus(((Plutus))) Pioneer program]: focuses on Plutus(((Plutus))), Cardano’s smart contract platform, offering hands-on experience in writing and deploying smart contracts(((smart contracts))). 
- https://sancho.network/drep-pioneer-program/drep-pp/overview[DRep Pioneer program]: prepares participants to become decentralized representatives, playing a crucial role in Cardano’s governance(((governance))). 
- https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-pioneer-program[Marlowe(((Marlowe))) Pioneer program]: specializes in Marlowe(((Marlowe))), a domain-specific language for financial contracts on Cardano, and is aimed at both developers and financial professionals.
- Tutorials: technical tutorials that describe features of Cardano and how to work with them.
- Educational videos: introduce technical aspects, new features, hard fork events, and so on.
- Hackathon support: writing hackathon challenges and attending the event to support the participants.

The first Cardano developer course was delivered online in conjunction with https://www.theafricablockchaincenter.com/[the African Blockchain Center] to participants from the African region and covered the core modules of Haskell(((Haskell))) fundamentals and smart contract development languages, including Aiken(((Aiken))), Plutus(((Plutus))), and Marlowe(((Marlowe))). This course evolved from the original Haskell(((Haskell))) course and was expanded to include lectures on Aiken(((Aiken))). A further iteration of the course was delivered in person at the https://utn.edu.ar/es/[Universidad Technológica Nacional] in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

We have delivered several Pioneer Programs aimed at developers and new users. These interactive online training courses aim to widen the reach of IO’s education resources and have been completed by over nine thousand people. During these programs, participants attend weekly lectures delivered by Lars Brünjes, director of education at IO, who also held weekly follow-up interactive Q&A sessions. Learners are supported by a thriving community in the Discord chat system that encouraged collaboration and problem-solving.

One of the most positive outcomes of these courses was the amazing community participation on Discord. The participants supported each other, created additional learning resources, were quick to report any issues, and tested features – they really were acting as true pioneers. We also saw a wide range of innovative resources and ideas from the courses, including new wallets, training materials, and new projects on Cardano.

A self-paced Cardano Education Program (CEP) is currently being developed where participants will be able to pick and choose the modules they want to complete and work at their own pace, rather than follow a weekly schedule.

===== About the Cardano developer portal

The https://developers.cardano.org/[Cardano developer portal] is an additional learning resource and is part of the Cardano.org domain: a product-and-vendor neutral contact point for technical topics. 

Guided by the principle of community involvement, all content is contributed openly and transparently using a GitHub process (branch, pull request, review, merge). This approach allows anyone to submit proposals with new or updated Markdown-formatted content and thus contribute actively and constructively.

Under the hood, https://docusaurus.io/[Docusaurus] (an open-source(((open-source))) project for building, deploying, and maintaining websites) works as a generator of web pages with extensive search functions.

The content of this developer portal is intended to practically demonstrate and exemplify how certain functions and operations can be implemented on Cardano, as well as showcase existing projects. A basic requirement for including projects is that they must be functioning and usable on the mainnet (see the guideline for https://developers.cardano.org/docs/portal-contribute/#add-a-project-to-showcase[adding new projects]).

This portal provides resources to https://developers.cardano.org/docs/integrate-cardano/[integrate Cardano], https://developers.cardano.org/docs/transaction-metadata/[build with transaction metadata], https://developers.cardano.org/docs/native-tokens/[explore native tokens], https://developers.cardano.org/docs/smart-contracts/[create smart contracts(((smart contracts)))], https://developers.cardano.org/docs/governance(((governance)))/[participate in governance(((governance)))], and https://developers.cardano.org/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/[operate a stake pool].

Contributions from all individuals, including non-developers, are encouraged to foster continuous evolution by the community. Contributing to the portal can boost reputation and visibility, or serve as a good learning experience in the GitHub open-source(((open-source))) and knowledge-minded contribution process. Each contribution acts as a valuable addition to your resume, potentially leading to career opportunities within the Cardano ecosystem. Ways to contribute include spreading awareness, creating issues on GitHub or the Cardano Forum, improving the copy by fixing errors or enhancing writing, and creating explanatory graphics.
There is a dedicated section that describes https://developers.cardano.org/docs/portal-contribute/[how best to contribute].

The https://developers.cardano.org/docs/portal-contribute/[Builder Tools] section of the portal encourages the addition of valuable tools that benefit Cardano developers. Guidelines for adding tools include being an actual builder tool, having a stable domain name, and using a GitHub account with a history or presence in the Cardano community.

The documentation in the portal can always be improved, and users are encouraged to contribute by creating and enhancing tutorials. Reviewing pull requests is another way to contribute, requiring technical understanding and prior contributions. The FAQs cover topics such as the pull request review process, becoming a reviewer, getting added to the contributor list, and connecting with the developer community through Discord and the forum.
