[[OuroborosConsensus]]
=== Ouroboros consensus

Ouroboros(((Ouroboros))) is a family of proof of stake protocols powering Cardano. It is backed by years of research and numerous peer-reviewed publications <<OuroborosClassicPaper>><<OuroborosPraosPaper>><<OuroborosGenesisPaper>>

This chapter builds an intuitive understanding of how Ouroboros works, providing the foundation needed to make sense of the formal papers that describe the algorithm in mathematical detail.

Let's start with a definition:

[quote, Intersect MBO]
____
Ouroboros is the name of a family of proof of stake consensus protocols that provides the foundation for Cardano and other blockchains. Distributed consensus is the mechanism through which a single, linear, eventually consistent chain of blocks is established among all participants of the network.
____

This brief definition represents hundreds of years of combined engineering effort.
The rest of the chapter will unpack each part of it to make sense of its full meaning.

==== Why do we need consensus algorithms?

All blockchains have a consensus algorithm: Bitcoin uses proof of work, Filecoin uses proof of storage, and Cardano uses Ouroboros(((Ouroboros))) proof of stake.
But before we go any further, let’s ask ourselves: why are consensus(((consensus))) algorithms necessary?

The fundamental reasons boil down to simple facts of nature:

* The _CAP_ theorem
* The speed light is not instantaneous, so there is always _latency_.


For example, imagine setting up a financial system that settles transactions worldwide, with a server located on every continent.

image::ouroboros_distributed_system.png[A global distributed system]

You would want to ensure:

* Partition tolerance — so that if a tsunami hits the Atlantic, the system can keep operating.
* Strong consistency — so that transactions across all continents are properly recorded, preventing double spending (when someone tries to use the same money in two different transactions).
* Low latency — so transactions on each continent are processed quickly, speeding up the payment system.

But as it is explained in the CAP and PCAELC theorems, _we can't have what we want, but [using a consensus algorithm] we might get what we need_.

===== The CAP and PACELC theorems

Professor Eric A. Brewer defined the CAP theorem, and paraphrasing it means:

[quote]
____
When having a distributed [data store] system, you can only have two out of the three properties:

* Consistency — every read receives the most recent write or an error.
* Availability — every request to a server receives a response
* Partition tolerance — the system continues to operate even in the presence of network errors
____

Later, Dr. Danil Abadi extended the CAP theorem with the PACELC theorem(((PACELC))), paraphrased thus:

[quote]
____
If there is a partition,
decide between consistency or availability.
Else,
choose between low latency or consistency.
____

image::ouroboros_pcaelc_theorem.png[PCAELC theorem]


In our example of a global financial system,
a partition would be like a tsunami severing the interoceanic cables, leaving continents separated into isolated regions.
If we want to maintain consistency, then new transactions would be forbidden on both sides of the Atlantic, ensuring we always respond with the most up-to-date information.
Alternatively, if we want to keep transactions flowing (availability), then the different servers’ records would slowly drift apart and lose consistency.

Even without a tsunami, the fact that the speed of light takes several seconds to travel across the planet means that if we want a consistent system, we have to give up on low latency and wait for every transaction to be synchronized.

But despite what the CAP theorem says, we _must_ deliver high consistency, low latency, and partition tolerance.

So, what do we do?

==== Nakamoto consensus (longest chain rule)

Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a solution to the problem of decentralized consensus,
by inventing the _blockchain_ data structure and the _longest chain rule(((longest chain rule)))_,
forming what is now known as the _Nakamoto consensus_.

Transactions are collected into _blocks_, each of which references the hash of the previous block,
forming a cryptographically linked chain. Participants in the network propagate new transactions
using a _gossip protocol_, so that each node has a (roughly) consistent view of pending transactions.

These pending transactions are stored in each node’s local _mempool(((mempool)))_ (short for 'memory pool').
The mempool is a temporary buffer of unconfirmed transactions waiting to be included in a block.
Each node maintains its own version of the mempool, and while they are usually similar,
they can differ slightly due to network latency and topology, or policy differences (eg, minimum fee requirements).
Miners select transactions from their mempool when building a new block,
often prioritizing those with higher transaction fees.

image::ouroboros_mempool.png[Each validator (miner/SPO) has its own mempool]

Network participants (miners) [in Cardano — stake pool operators (SPOs)] independently assemble candidate blocks from their mempool
and _compete_ to solve a cryptographic puzzle (proof of work) [in Cardano — proof of stake(((proof of stake)))].
The first miner to find a valid solution broadcasts the block to the rest of the network.

Once verified, the new block is appended to each node’s local copy of the blockchain,
and the transactions it contains are removed from the mempool(((mempool))).
The process then repeats.

If the network becomes partitioned, or two miners [SPOs(((SPO)))] solve the puzzle at nearly the same time,
_temporary forks_ may occur, ie for a moment in time there will be two versions of what could eventually be in the canonincal blockchain.
It is for this reason, that it is often advised to wait a certain number of blocks (e.g. six blocks in Bitcoin),
until it is assumed that a block has been immutably added to the blockchain forever.
Eventually, one branch of the fork becomes longer as more blocks are added,
and it is that longer branch that will be adopted by all nodes.

image::ouroboros_longest_chain.png[Longest chain]

All honest nodes converge on this _longest chain_, discarding blocks from shorter forks.
Transactions in the discarded blocks may be re-added to the mempool if they haven’t already been confirmed in some block in the longest chain.

image::ouroboros_longest_chain_consensus.png[validators continue in the longest chain]

At this point, it is important to mention how similar the original Nakamoto consensus(((Nakamoto, Consensus))) and the Ouroboros consensus are.
In fact, Ouroboros is Nakamoto consensus(((Nakamoto, Consensus))).
The main difference is how they select the network participant (ie, the miner in Bitcoin or the SPO in Cardano).

Bitcoin uses proof of work, and Cardano uses proof of stake, or more precisely, a verifiable random function(((verifiable random function))).

==== How does proof of work select a validator (miner)?

In proof of work, the network participants (miners) _compete_ with each other to find a 'magic number' (nonce) that makes the block fulfill a rule (complexity).
So proof of work is like a _race_ where all the _miners_ have to jump through hoops to be rewarded.

Proof of work(((proof of work))) is then like a hurdle race, where there is only one winner.


===== What is the 'race' about?

We can see a block of the Bitcoin network as a data structure with the following fields:

image::ouroboros_basic_block_structure.png[Basic block structure]

And then, the 'race' is about trying to calculate the hash function that given the data and the nonce(((nonce))),
returns a current block hash(((current block hash))) that has the desired number of leading zeros ('0000') -- this can also be thought about as finding a current block hash that is less than a desired threshold.

But in order to calculate the current block hash(((current block hash))), the only way is to try nonce numbers at random.
Like in this image, we try with 0, 17... and so on.

image::ouroboros_trying_with_nonce.png[Different attempts to find a nonce]

Until, finally, we find the nonce that produces the correct current block hash:

image::ouroboros_valid_nonce.png[Found a nonce that Works]

As you can imagine, this approach of randomly generating a nonce(((nonce))) and testing whether the resulting hash meets the desired difficulty is very computationally intensive.

That’s the ‘work’ in ‘proof of work’.

However, this approach comes with some disadvantages.

===== Proof of work disadvantages

* Wasting electricity.
Bitcoin is famously known for consuming as much electricity as a small country.
Returning to our analogy, the fact that all runners must run every race (each hoping to win the single reward) results in a significant waste of energy.

* It leads to centralization in mining pools.
A mining pool is a group of miners who collaborate by combining their computing power to calculate the hash and share the resulting rewards.
In our analogy, it’s as if marathon runners formed teams and ran together.
If one team member wins the race, the reward is shared among the entire team.

* It also leads to manufacturing centralization and electronic waste.
Since mining equipment in proof of work systems performs only one task (calculating a hash) this has driven the development of specialized hardware known as ‘miners’.
However, once these miners become obsolete, they serve no other purpose, contributing to growing levels of electronic waste(((electronic waste))).


And although these disadvantages make headlines today,
a group of visionaries — led by Professor Aggelos Kiayias(((Kiayias, Aggelos))), chief scientist at IO Research — recognized them early on.
They began developing an alternative to proof of work,
centered on the idea of proof of stake and Ouroboros in particular.

==== Proof of stake as an alternative to proof of work

If proof of work is a marathon, proof of stake is a _relay race_.

Only one runner, called the _slot leader(((slot leader)))_, runs each segment (block) of the race.
That runner delivers the message (a block of transactions) to the next runner,
who is randomly selected from a thousand others waiting to be chosen.

From this perspective, the benefits of proof of stake become clear:

- Only one runner means no wasted electricity
- The hardware requirements are minimal — any generic computer capable of calculating a cryptographic hash function can participate
- There is no incentive to form mining pools (teams) — since the chance of being selected as the next slot leader is proportional to the amount of stake — ie, one's _investment_ in the network or the trust of other users that delegate their stake to SPOs
- This reduces incentives for centralization
- The protocol is open — the hardware is not controlled by any one manufacturer, and even the software can be implemented by multiple independent teams.

===== How does Ouroboros (Praos) work?

Time in Cardano is divided into _epochs_, and each epoch(((epoch))) is further subdivided into _slots_.
Currently (2025), one epoch has 432000 slots, and each slot lasts one second.
So each epoch is approximately five days.

During each slot:

- Servers (nodes) gather and broadcast transactions using a _gossip protocol_
- These transactions accumulate in each node's local _mempool_.

Even though slots last 1 second,
not every slot results in a block.
Cardano is designed so that, on average, one block is produced every 20 seconds.
This is controlled by a parameter called the _active slot coefficient(((active slot coefficient)))_,
which is currently set to 0.05, or 5%.

A block is produced at the end of a slot only if that slot is one of the 5% designated as active.

If a block is generated, a cryptographic lottery takes place.

All SPOs compute a verifiable random function(((verifiable random function))) (VRF).
This VRF takes the following inputs:

* a _random seed_ that is updated each epoch
* the SPO's private key
* and a label to distinguish repeated uses of the VRF.

The random seed is derived from data in the previous blocks.

The VRF produces a random output and a proof.
The beauty of a VRF is that others can later verify that the output was computed correctly from the given inputs without being able to guess it beforehand.
Each node’s VRF output is essentially that node’s 'lottery number' for the slot, and the proof is like a signed ticket.

On each slot, each SPO effectively asks themselves:

[quote]
---
Am I the slot leader for current slot?
---


If the output of the VRF (((verifiable random function))) falls below a threshold — set based on the amount of stake the operator controls — then the SPO becomes the slot leader(((slot leader))) for that slot.

That slot leader(((slot leader))):

- Selects transactions from the mempool
- Constructs a new block
- Signs the block
- Broadcasts the signed block to the network.

Cardano accumulates rewards (from block minting and fees) and distributes them to stake pools and delegators at the end of each epoch according to an incentive formula.

Then, all stake pool operators(((stake pool operators))) verify the validity of the previous block during the next slot by:

* Checking the block’s signature to ensure it was signed by a registered pool’s key.
* Verifying the VRF proof included in the block, which confirms the slot leader’s output, was below the threshold.
So any node can confirm, 'Yes, the creator of this block had the right to do so for slot N.'
Preventing malicious nodes from falsifying leadership. The Ouroboros Praos(((Ouroboros, Praos))) specification calls this the 'proof of leadership' included in each block.
If the proof is invalid or the node was not eligible, the block is rejected.
* Validating all transactions within the block, including signatures and UTXOs, as with any blockchain.

Once validated, SPOs append the block to their local copy of the chain.

In Cardano, rewards are paid to SPOs and delegators at the end of each epoch, but with a delay of one full epoch after the one in which the rewards were earned.

The delay allows the network to:

* Finalize the stake snapshot used to calculate each delegator's share
* Calculate the actual rewards based on the number of blocks produced, the active stake, fees collected, and the pool’s parameters (margin, fixed cost).

Then, the process restarts for the next epoch.

===== Why is it called 'Ouroboros'?

The name *Ouroboros(((Ouroboros)))* — the ancient symbol of a snake eating its own tail — reflects how each epoch feeds into the next.

In Ouroboros, each slot’s randomness (used to determine slot leaders) is derived from
the data of previous epochs. The blockchain uses its _own past_ to seed its _own future_,
creating a secure, self-referential cycle.

That is how the snake eats its own tail.

==== Different versions of Ouroboros

The version of Ouroboros described here is best understood as Ouroboros Praos;
however, other versions exist that relax different underlying assumptions.

* Ouroboros Classic<<OuroborosClassicPaper>> (2017) — first proof of stake protocol with a security proof, but required synchronous communication and used a multiparty coin-flipping protocol to generate randomness.
* Ouroboros Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)<<OuroborosBftPaper>> (2018) — interim federated version used during the Cardano Byron reboot
* Ouroboros Praos<<OuroborosPraosPaper>> (2018) — introduced private VRF-based leader selection and supported semi-synchronous networks
* Ouroboros Genesis<<OuroborosGenesisPaper>> (2019) — improved fork-choice rule enabling trustless bootstrapping and dynamic availability
* Ouroboros Chronos<<OuroborosChronosPaper>> (2019) — added secure time synchronization to Ouroboros (not yet implemented)
* Ouroboros Leios<<OuroborosLeiosDiscussion>><<OuroborosLeiosPaper>> (2022, 2025) — designed for throughput scaling through parallel chains and role separation.


===== Ouroboros Classic (2017)

The first version of Ouroboros demonstrated that a proof of stake protocol could match the security guarantees of proof of work,
provided that at least 51% of the stake is controlled by honest participants.
However, it assumed a synchronous network, where all nodes are online and messages are delivered within a known, fixed delay.
This was a significant step forward, but not yet practical.

===== Ouroboros BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant, 2018)

Used during the Cardano Byron reboot.
Enabled a federated blockchain, where trusted parties — IOG, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation — ran their own nodes.


===== Ouroboros Praos (2018)

To increase the resistance of Ouroboros against fully-adaptive corruption
(ie where an attaker can corrupt anyone at any time)
This required better randomness,
To select a slot leader.

However, in traditional computing, nothing is truly random.
To address this, Ouroboros Praos(((Ouroboros, Praos))) introduced the concept of a verifiable random function(((verifiable random function))), which uses inputs that cannot be controlled or predicted by any party as seeds for randomness:

* Current time-stamp (ie slot number)
* Epoch specific nonce

So no single entity can predict or control any of those values.


===== Ouroboros Genesis (2019) improved chain selection and bootstrap

With Ouroboros Praos(((Ouroboros, Praos))), the main hurdles to establishing a secure proof of stake system were overcome.
Ouroboros Genesis(((Ouroboros, Genesis))) allowed a new node, or a node that was disconnected for a long time.
To sync to the correct fork of the chain using only the genesis block.
Whithout the need to have trusted snapshots.

===== Ouroboros Chronos (2019) decentralized time synchronization

Chronos is a more recent development in the Ouroboros family, focusing on an often-overlooked aspect — time synchronization in distributed systems. Ouroboros assumes a global notion of time, where each slot corresponds to a one-second interval. In practice, however, nodes rely on their local system clocks to determine slot boundaries. If an adversary could significantly skew these clocks, or if there were no shared time reference, consensus could break, for example, if nodes disagreed on slot numbers.

Chronos addresses this by introducing a mechanism for nodes to securely synchronize their clocks using the blockchain itself as a reference. It effectively transforms the blockchain into a decentralized time oracle.

Chronos removes the need for external time sources such as Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers, which can act as single points of failure or attack. Instead, nodes periodically run an internal protocol embedded in the blockchain process to agree on the current time, detecting and correcting any clock drift or malicious manipulation.

This makes the system more resilient to time-based attacks.
For example, it becomes much harder for an attacker to isolate a node by feeding it a false clock and disrupting its slot scheduling.

===== Ouroboros Leios (2022, 2205) a high throughput and parallel processing consensus protocol

The previous variants of Ouroboros have shown that a proof of stake consensus is practical, secure and resilient.
However, challenges remain. The biggest one of them is throughput.

Throughput((throughput)), the number of transactions that a blockchain can process per second,
is still low, compared to centralized systems.

====== Why is throughput 'low' in blockchains in general, and in Praos in particular?

As you remember from our description, there is one slot per second,
but only 5% (one in twenty) slots produce a block.
This means that for 19 seconds the SPO is 'idle'.
The reality is more complicated:
the block density must remain low to allow sufficient time for transactions to propagate through the network (currently around 5 seconds)
Leaving three quarters of the time unused.
However, this idle time is essential to maintain the blockchain’s security properties.

These limitations led to a discussion paper<<OuroborosLeiosDiscussion>>,
where Input Output engineers began brainstorming a better version of Ouroboros: Leios.

Leios would have a pipeline architecture,
which would hepl exploit idle resource time and approach the theoretical throughput limit of network bandwidth.

In the begining of the pipeline, all transactions would be stored in Input Blocks (IBs).
Which will allow it to create IBs close to network capacity.
Then, each IB would be sent through a seven-stage pipeline:
Propose, Deliver1, Link, Deliver2, Vote1, Endorse and Vote2.
IBs are referenced in later stages to create Endorsement Blocks (EBs).
Later EBs are certified, and then referenced by Base protocol blocks (BBs).
BBs are the ones that have the consensus and ordering,
ie the backbone of the blockchain.

.Table: Summary of the different block types, their purpose and relationships
.Summary of Leios Block Types and Their Properties
[cols="h,2,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| | Input Blocks (IBs) | Endorsement Blocks (EBs) | Base Protocol Blocks (BB)

| Purpose
| Carries transaction payload
| Certifies the existence/availability of IBs and links protocol history together
| Final consensus backbone

| Contains
| A list of ledger transactions
| References (hashes or identifiers) to IBs and other EBs.
| References to certified EBs

| Frequency
| High rate, set to be a fraction of the network capacity (eg 1 per 0.2 to 2 seconds)
| Lower rate, independent of the IB rate, determined by protocol security parameters. (eg 1 per 5 to 10 seconds)
| Determined by base procol, approximaately 1 per 15 - 30s

| Generated at pipeline stage
| Propose (1st stage)
| Link (3rd stage)  and Endorse (6th stage) to reference other EBs
| After Vote2 on the base blockchain schedule
|===

With the combined new blocks (IB and EBS) plus pipeline processing architecture,
Leios can achieve significantly higher throughput.

===== Queueing delays and Equivocations

Most blockchains that provide formal specifications for their properties rely on the so-called $$\Delta delay model$$.
This model assumes that all messages sent by honest parties are delivered within time $$\Delta$$.
As a result, the model doesn't match how a real gossip network protocol works.

To better simulate a gossip protocol,
IO Research developed a more realistic network model in 2025, called:
Queueing delays and Equivocations(((Queueing delays and Equivocations,QUEQ))) (QUEQ)
Then they tested the design of Leios, in the new QUEQ model.
To prove that Leios still satisfied, the same security warranties as Ouroboros Praos.

Leios inherits its core security properties, like persistence, from its base protocol.
By paying a small penalty in finality (because of the delays introduced by the pipeline),
It gets a lot more throughput.

==== In conclusion

At this point, it becomes clear how the development of the first practical proof of stake consensus algorithm in Ouroboros was made possible.
How each iteration improved on the limitations and assumptions of the previous one,
how the algorithm’s security is grounded in mathematical probability defined by blockchain parameters,
and how varying certain assumptions allows for tuned versions of the protocol suited to specific applications.
