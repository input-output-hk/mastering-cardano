== 6.1 Fundamentals of crypto wallets

A wallet, also known as a crypto wallet, digital wallet, or cryptocurrency wallet, is like a digital version of a regular wallet. However, instead of holding cash, personal identification, or cards, it keeps special digital keys that allow interaction with various blockchains to enable users to manage digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, tokens, or non-functional tokens (NFTs).

These keys are what you use to access your digital assets. Just like you use a key to open a safety box lock, you use these digital keys to access and manage your digital assets.

At its core, a wallet serves two primary purposes:
* _\2_ Your wallet securely stores your ’keys’ – unique, sophisticated digital codes known as ‘public keys’ and ‘private keys.’ The public key is like your email address; you share it with others to receive cryptocurrency. The private key, akin to your email password, must be kept secret. It's what allows you to send or spend your cryptocurrency.  
* _\2_ A wallet enables you to send and receive digital currencies like ada, Cardano's native currency. When you send cryptocurrency, you essentially sign off ownership to the receiver's wallet. Your private key validates this transaction, acting as a digital signature that provides mathematical proof of your authorization.

It’s crucial to understand that a wallet doesn't store your cryptocurrency physically. Instead, it holds the cryptographic information required to access and transact with your digital assets on the blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies. This makes your wallet a crucial tool for managing your digital assets securely and efficiently. In this section, you will learn the generalities of wallets before going into the details of how wallets work in Cardano.

=== 6.1.1 Types of wallets

In the blockchain realm, keeping your digital assets secure and accessible is crucial. This is where the choice of a wallet comes into play. Crypto wallets can be broadly categorized into three types: _\2_, _\2_, and _\2_.

Each type offers a different balance of security and convenience, catering to various needs and preferences. Let's explore these three main types of wallets before diving into the specifics:
* _\2_ Imagine a hardware wallet as a secure USB stick that stores your cryptocurrency and other digital assets offline. These physical devices are considered one of the safest options because they keep your private keys completely disconnected from the internet, reducing the risk of hacking. They are ideal for long-term investors who want to keep their assets secure for an extended period.  
* _\2_ Software wallets are applications that you can install on your computer or smartphone. They are more convenient for daily transactions, balancing security and accessibility. Since they are connected to the internet, they are considered ‘hot wallets.’ While they are generally secure, they are more vulnerable to online threats than hardware wallets. Software wallets are perfect for active trading users needing frequent cryptocurrency access.  
* _\2_ A paper wallet is a physical document that contains a public address for receiving cryptocurrencies and a private key for spending or transferring them. It's essentially a piece of paper with public and private keys, printed as QR codes.. Paper wallets offer a highly secure method for storing cryptocurrencies since they are entirely offline. However, they can be easily damaged or lost, and they are not as convenient for quick or frequent transactions.

It’s also important to note that paper and hardware wallets are also known as ‘cold wallets’ or ‘cold storage’ wallets, as they always keep private keys offline.

Each type of wallet has its unique features, advantages, and considerations. The choice between them depends on your specific needs, such as the level of security you require, how frequently you plan to access your cryptocurrency, and your comfort level with technology. The following sections explore each type in detail, helping you decide which wallet best suits your journey into the world of Cardano and the blockchain.

=== 6.1.2 Hardware wallets

Hardware wallets are physical devices that store users’ private keys securely offline. They connect to a computer via USB ports and are designed to provide the highest level of security for digital assets. By keeping private keys offline, hardware wallets protect cryptocurrencies and digital assets from online hacking attempts, malware, and other cyber threats.

These wallets offer an excellent balance between security and usability, making them particularly suited for long-term investors or individuals with significant digital asset holdings. While considerations such as cost and potential risks of physical loss exist, the security benefits of keeping private keys offline often outweigh these drawbacks.

Choosing the right hardware wallet depends on your specific needs, including the cryptocurrencies you hold, your budget, and how you plan to use your digital assets.

Let’s delve deeper into the pros and cons of using hardware wallets, along with some common models available in the market.

_\2_
* _\2_ The main advantage of hardware wallets is their ability to keep private keys offline, making them less prone to online hacking attacks. Transactions are signed within the device, meaning the private keys never leave the device.  
* _\2_ Despite their robust security features, hardware wallets are small and portable, allowing you to manage your cryptocurrencies and digital assets wherever you are with access to a computer or a smartphone.  
* _\2_ Most hardware wallets are designed to support multiple cryptocurrencies and blockchains, making them a versatile choice for users holding various digital assets.  
* _\2_ Modern hardware wallets come with easy-to-use interfaces, making it straightforward for users, even newcomers, to manage their holdings.

_\2_
* _\2_ Unlike software or paper wallets, hardware wallets come with a price tag. The cost can be a barrier for people just starting with cryptocurrencies or those with a small amount of digital assets.  
* _\2_ While they are less prone to online threats, hardware wallets are physical devices that can be damaged, lost, or stolen. Users must take precautions to protect their devices and back up their recovery phrases.  
* _\2_ For users who frequently trade or access their cryptocurrencies or digital assets, hardware wallets may be less convenient than software wallets due to the need to connect the device to a computer or mobile device.

=== 6.1.4 Paper wallets

Paper wallets are a form of cold storage for cryptocurrencies and digital assets, as they remain offline and are not vulnerable to online hacking attacks. A paper wallet is a physical document containing all the necessary data for accessing and managing digital assets. This document typically includes a public address (used by others to send funds) and a private key, which allows the owner to access and transfer their funds.

Let's explore the advantages and disadvantages of paper wallets, along with some standard practices in the blockchain realm for effective management.

_\2_
* _\2_ Since they are offline, paper wallets are immune to online hacking attacks, malware, and other digital threats, making them one of the most secure cryptocurrency storage methods.  
* _\2_ With a paper wallet, you have complete control over your private keys and, consequently, your cryptocurrency and digital assets. There's no reliance on third-party services or risks associated with online wallet providers.  
* _\2_ Creating a paper wallet is essentially free, requiring only paper and a printer, unlike hardware wallets, which can be expensive.

_\2_
* _\2_ Paper wallets can be less user-friendly, especially for those not well-versed in blockchain technology. The process of transferring funds to and from a paper wallet is more cumbersome than using software or hardware wallets.  
* _\2_ Paper is prone to wear, tear, damage, and loss. If the paper wallet is damaged or lost without abackup, the funds stored on it become irretrievable.  
* _\2_ Paper wallets offer a different level of convenience compared to other wallet types. They're best suited for long-term storage rather than for frequent trading or spending.

Next, we'll review some standard methods for generating a paper wallet.

_\2_

The following practices are _\2_ recommendations intended for informational purposes only 
* _\2_ A common practice to generate a paper wallet is creating a pair of public and private keys through a secure software or hardware wallet. After these keys are generated, the public key can be printed on paper. If needed, a QR code can be created to represent each key.  
* _\2_ Some websites like link:https://www.bitaddress.org/[BitAddress.org] allow the creation of paper wallets. However, some of these websites have been flagged as insecure and potentially malware. When using this mechanism, ensure you use a secure, trusted website to avoid malicious code.  
* _\2_ For enhanced security, the paper wallet should be generated offline, on a computer that is not and has never been connected to the internet, to prevent exposure to online threats.  
* _\2_ The wallet should be printed with an offline printer to avoid any digital traces of your private keys. Using a printer that doesn't retain memory or a brand-new printer is advisable.  
* _\2_ Once printed, the paper wallet should be stored in a safe, waterproof, and fireproof location. Some users opt for safes or safety deposit boxes. Creating multiple copies and storing them in different secure locations is also wise.  
* _\2_ Never share your paper wallet's private key or QR code with anyone. Exposure equals potential theft.  
* _\2_ When you want to move digital assets in a paper wallet, you'll typically need to import your private key into a software wallet to conduct transactions.

When created and stored correctly, paper wallets offer a high-security option for storing cryptocurrencies and digital assets. They are particularly suited for long-term investors who wish to keep their digital assets securely without the need for regular access or trading. However, the potential risks of physical damage, loss, and the technical challenges of using paper wallets should be carefully considered.

=== 6.1.5 Public and private keys in the context of wallets

Understanding the role of public and private keys is fundamental when using a wallet to manage digital assets. Public and private keys are like the username and password to your online bank account, but with some particularities that we will discuss.

_\2_

Think of the public key as your home address. Just like you can share your address with friends so they can send you letters or packages, you can share your public key with others to receive cryptocurrency or any other digital assets. It's a string of letters and numbers derived from your private key, but it's safe to share with others because, while it can receive funds, it can't be used to withdraw any.

Imagine selling lemonade and asking people to leave money in a locked box at your front door (your public key). They can deposit money, but only you can unlock the box to retrieve it because you have the key – your private key..

The wallet private key is like the key to that locked box. Like a public key, it consists of a string of letters and numbers but should always be kept secret since it allows you to access and control your assets. With your private key, you can send your cryptocurrency and digital assets to others, sign transactions to prove you own the assets, and even access your funds if you switch to a new wallet.

Following the example of selling lemonade, you only hold the key to the padlock, allowing you to open it and retrieve the money left by customers. If someone else gains access of your key, they can take all the money, just as obtaining your private key enables unauthorized access to your cryptocurrency.

Blockchainkeys facilitate transaction processing and approval. The public key serves as the address for sending or receiving funds, while the private key is the secret that controls access to personal assets. Securing your private key is crucial because anyone with it can access your assets. Just like you wouldn't share the key to your safe with strangers, you should never share your private key with anyone.

=== 6.1.6 Wallet addresses

A wallet address is similar to an email address or a home address – it's a unique identifier used to receive funds. When someone sends you cryptocurrency or other digital assets, they send it to your wallet address.

A wallet address is a string of letters and numbers representing the destination for a blockchain transaction that involves moving assets from one address to another. It's generated based on the public key and, depending on the blockchain, goes through a series of cryptographic transformations to create a shorter, more user-friendly address.

These are examples of what wallet addresses look like for Cardano, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. Each of these addresses is a string of characters that includes numbers and letters, both uppercase and lowercase, specific to the blockchain they belong to:

----

Cardano addresses typically start with +\1+ and are longer than Ethereum and Bitcoin addresses, reflecting the network's unique addressing scheme.

The length of a Cardano address can vary, primarily because it uses the \``+\1+ `+\1+0x+\1+1+\1+3+\1+bc1+\1+1+\1+cardano-js-sdk`) as described in link:https://www.lace.io/blog/cardano-js-sdk-empowering-the-community-through-open-source[this article] of Lace’s blog.

=== 6.3.1 Sending and receiving digital assets on Cardano

Sending and receiving digital assets is the most common operation in blockchain wallets. On Cardano, you can manage and send various digital assets, including:
* _\2_ Ada is the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano blockchain. It's used for transactions, staking, and paying transaction fees on the network.  
* _\2_ With the introduction of the Mary upgrade to the Cardano blockchain, users can create and distribute their custom tokens. These tokens operate on the same blockchain as ada without needing smart contracts to handle the custom token logic. This feature enables various assets to be managed and transacted directly through Cardano wallets.  
* _\2_ Cardano also supports the creation and exchange of NFTs, unique digital assets verified using blockchain technology that represents ownership of specific items or content, such as art and collectibles.

Cardano's design separates the data layer (where transactions are recorded) from the computation layer (where smart contracts are executed), allowing for efficient handling of different digital assets with reduced costs and improved speed. This makes Cardano wallets versatile tools for managing ada, native tokens, and NFTs within the same ecosystem.

Sending and receiving digital assets on Cardano involves a straightforward process that anyone with a Cardano wallet can perform. Below is the general process for sending and receiving ada or other CNTs, including NFTs, using any Cardano wallet.

_\2_

Before you can send or receive digital assets, you need a few essential components:
* A Cardano wallet. You must have a Cardano-compatible wallet, such as Daedalus, Lace, Nami, Yoroi, or another wallet that supports Cardano transactions.  
* Wallet setup. Ensure your wallet is properly set up. This includes installing and updating your wallet software and going through any necessary setup procedures, such as creating or restoring a wallet.  
* Funds in wallet. To send ada or other tokens, you need to have enough ada in your wallet to cover the transaction and any associated fees.  
* Recipient's address. You need the recipient's wallet address to send assets. This should be a valid Cardano address provided by the person or entity you’re sending assets to.

Once your Cardano wallet is ready, you can send or receive digital assets as follows.

_\2_

Here’s the typical process for sending ada or other tokens from a Cardano wallet:
. Access your wallet. Open your Cardano wallet application on your device.  
. Enter the recipient's address. Navigate to the send section of your wallet. Here, you'll need to input the recipient’s Cardano address accurately. Double-check this address to avoid sending assets to the wrong person.  
. Specify the amount. Enter the amount of ada or the specific tokens you wish to send. If you are sending NFTs, you’ll select the particular asset from your inventory.  
. Confirm transaction details. Review the transaction details, including the recipient's address, the amount, and the transaction fee.  
. Authorize and send. Confirm the transaction, usually by entering a password or PIN, and if applicable, approve the transaction using any additional security features like 2FA or a hardware wallet confirmation.  
. Wait for confirmation. The transaction will be processed on the Cardano blockchain once sent. You can check the status in your wallet or use a Cardano blockchain explorer to see when it has been confirmed.

_\2_

Receiving ada or other tokens is more straightforward and requires the following steps:
. Access your wallet. Open your Cardano wallet.  
. Locate your wallet address. Navigate to the receive section of your wallet. You’ll find your Cardano wallet address, which you can copy here.  
. Share your address. Provide your Cardano address to the person or service you expect to receive assets from. You can share this address directly or via a QR code if your wallet provides one.  
. Check for incoming transactions. Once the sender initiates the transaction, you can monitor your wallet for the incoming funds. The assets will appear in your wallet once the blockchain confirms the transaction.

Following these steps, you can send and receive digital assets on any Cardano wallet. We encourage you to read the wallet’s documentation for detailed information on conducting these actions in a particular wallet.

=== 6.3.2 Staking ada

Ada held on the Cardano network represents a stake in the network, with the size of the stake proportional to the amount of ada held. 

Staking ada involves participating in transaction validation on the Cardano blockchain. By staking your ada, you support network operations and help verify transactions. In return, you earn rewards in additional ada, incentivizing participants to maintain network integrity.

An ada holder can earn rewards by delegating their stake to a stake pool or by running their own stake pool. The amount of delegated stake influences the Ouroboros protocol's selection of who adds the next block and receives rewards.

The more stake is delegated to a stake pool (up to a certain point), the more likely it is to produce the next block and share rewards with its delegators.

==== 6.3.2.1 Staking ada using a Cardano wallet

Staking ada using a Cardano wallet involves a few straightforward steps that allow you to earn rewards by participating in the network's consensus mechanism. Below is a detailed guide on how to stake your ada.

_\2_

First, you need a Cardano wallet that supports staking, such as Dedalus, Yoroi, or Lace. The example wallets are provided for informational purposes only and are not endorsed by the authors. Their use is strictly at your responsibility.

_\2_
* Download and install your chosen wallet  
* Create a new wallet or restore an existing one using the recovery phrase  
* Secure your wallet by setting a strong spending password and backing up your recovery phrase in a secure location.

_\2_
* If your ada is not already in your staking wallet, you should transfer it from where it’s currently held (another wallet or an exchange)  
* Use the receiving address from your Cardano wallet to transfer ada into it.

_\2_
* Within your wallet, navigate to the staking section or delegation center  
* Browse or search for stake pools; when selecting a pool, consider factors like:  
* Reliability: the pool's uptime and performance history  
* Fee structure: the amount that the stake pool charges for its services  
* Pool saturation: a measure of how much ada is already staked in the pool; overly saturated pools may offer diminishing returns  
* Rewards estimation: some wallets provide estimates of the rewards you might earn from staking with a particular pool.

_\2_
* Select the stake pool you want to delegate to  
* Delegate your ada by confirming the transaction in your wallet; to complete this process, you need to pay a small transaction fee in ada  
* Once delegated, your ada remains in your wallet; you simply assign your staking power to the pool.

_\2_
* After you've delegated your ada, you can monitor the performance of your chosen stake pool directly through your wallet.  
* Rewards are usually distributed automatically at the end of each epoch (every 5 days). These rewards will be added to your wallet balance and can be reinvested (re-delegated) to compound your holdings.  
* You can change stake pools at any time if you find another pool that offers better returns or aligns better with your preferences.

_\2_
* Stay informed. Monitor your stake pool's performance to maximize returns.  
* Security. Keep your wallet and recovery information secure. Never share private keys or recovery phrases.

Following these steps, you can effectively participate in staking ada, contributing to the Cardano network's security and decentralization while earning passive rewards. This process not only enhances the Cardano ecosystem's stability but also offers its participants financial benefits.

=== 6.3.3 Governance

Cardano wallets support governance actions within the ecosystem, particularly through Project Catalyst. This framework allows ada holders to propose, discuss, and vote on development projects enhancing the Cardano network.

Using wallets like Daedalus and Lace, users can participate in this decentralized governance process. Wallets provide interfaces for accessing the Catalyst voting system, where users can register and cast votes directly.

This empowers the community to influence the network's future, ensuring development aligns with global user interests. By participating in governance through their wallets, ada holders help shape Cardano's evolution, fostering an inclusive and democratic blockchain environment.
