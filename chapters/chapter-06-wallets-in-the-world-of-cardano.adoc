== Cardano digital wallets

[[wallets-fundamentals]]
=== Fundamentals of digital wallets

A digital wallet(((digital wallet))), also referred to as a crypto wallet, or cryptocurrency wallet, is a digital version of a regular wallet. However, instead of holding cash, personal identification, or cards, it stores special digital keys that enable interaction with various blockchains, allowing users to manage digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, tokens, or non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

These keys allow you to access and manage your digital assets. Just like a key that opens the lock of a safe, these digital keys do the same -- but give you access to funds and assets stored in the digital wallet.

At its core, a digital wallet serves two primary purposes:

* *Secure storage of keys* — your wallet securely stores your keys, which are unique, sophisticated digital codes known as public keys and private keys. The public key is like your email address; you share it with others to receive cryptocurrency. The private key, akin to your email password, allows you to send or spend your cryptocurrency, and must be kept secret.

* *Transaction management* — a wallet enables you to send and receive digital currencies, such as ada, Cardano's native currency. When you send cryptocurrency, you essentially sign off ownership to the receiver's wallet. Your private key validates this transaction, acting as a digital signature that provides mathematical proof of your authorization.

It is crucial to understand that a wallet does not physically store your cryptocurrency. Instead, it holds the cryptographic information required to access and transact with your digital assets on the blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies. This makes your wallet a crucial tool for managing your digital assets securely and efficiently. In this section, you will learn about the types of wallets as well as details of how wallets work in Cardano.

[[wallets-types]]
==== Types of wallets

Maintaining the security and accessibility of your digital assets is crucial. This is where the choice of a wallet(((digital wallet, types))) comes into play. Crypto wallets can be broadly categorized into three types: _hardware_, _software_, and _paper_.

Each type offers a different balance of security and convenience, catering to various needs and preferences. Let's explore these three main types of wallets before diving into the specifics:

* *Hardware wallets* — imagine a hardware wallet as a secure USB stick that stores your cryptocurrency and other digital assets offline (i.e. on a device that is not connected to the Internet). These physical devices are considered one of the safest options because they keep your private keys completely disconnected from the internet, reducing the risk of hacking. They are ideal for long-term investors who want to keep their assets secure for an extended period.

* *Software wallets* — software wallets are applications that can be installed on your computer or smartphone. They are more convenient for daily transactions, striking a balance between security and accessibility. Since they are connected to the internet, they are considered hot wallets. While they are generally secure, they are more vulnerable to online threats than hardware wallets. Software wallets are ideal for active trading users who require frequent access to cryptocurrencies.

* *Paper wallets* — a paper wallet is a physical document that contains a public address for receiving cryptocurrencies and a private key for spending or transferring them. It's a piece of paper with public and private keys, printed as QR codes. Paper wallets offer a highly secure method for storing cryptocurrencies since they are entirely offline. However, they can be easily damaged or lost, and they are not as convenient for quick or frequent transactions.

It is also important to note that paper and hardware wallets are also known as “cold wallets” or “cold storage” wallets, as they always keep private keys offline.

Each type of wallet has unique features, advantages, and considerations. Your choice depends on your specific needs, such as the level of security you require, how frequently you plan to access your cryptocurrency, and your comfort level with technology. The following sections provide an in-depth exploration of each type, helping you determine which wallet best suits your journey into the world of Cardano and the blockchain.

==== Hardware wallets

Hardware wallets(((hardware wallets))) are physical devices that store users’ private keys securely offline. They connect to a computer via USB ports and are designed to provide the highest level of security for digital assets. By keeping private keys offline, hardware wallets protect cryptocurrencies and digital assets from online hacking attempts, malware, and other cyber threats.

These wallets strike an excellent balance between security and usability, making them particularly well-suited for long-term investors or individuals with substantial digital asset holdings. While considerations such as cost and potential risks of physical loss exist, the security benefits of keeping private keys offline often outweigh these drawbacks.

Choosing the right hardware wallet depends on your specific needs, including the cryptocurrencies you hold, your budget, and how you plan to use your digital assets.

Let’s examine the pros and cons of using hardware wallets and some common models available on the market.

*Pros of hardware wallets*

* *Enhanced security* — the primary advantage of hardware wallets is their ability to store private keys offline, thereby reducing their vulnerability to online hacking attacks. Transactions are signed within the device, meaning the private keys never leave the device.

* *Portability* — despite their robust security features, hardware wallets are small and portable, allowing you to manage your cryptocurrencies and digital assets from anywhere with access to a computer or smartphone.

* *Multi-currency support* — most hardware wallets are designed to support multiple cryptocurrencies and blockchains, making them a versatile choice for users holding a variety of digital assets.

* *User-friendly* — modern hardware wallets feature user-friendly interfaces, making it straightforward for users, including newcomers, to manage their holdings.

*Cons of hardware wallets*

* *Cost* — unlike software or paper wallets, hardware wallets come with a price tag. The cost can be a barrier for people just starting with cryptocurrencies or those with a small amount of digital assets.

* *Physical damage or loss* — while they are less prone to online threats, hardware wallets are physical devices that can be damaged, lost, or stolen. Users must take precautions to protect their devices and back up their recovery phrases.

* *Less convenient for quick transactions* — for users who frequently trade or access their cryptocurrencies or digital assets, hardware wallets may be less convenient than software wallets due to the need to connect the device to a computer or mobile device for transactions.

==== Software wallets

Software wallets(((software wallets)))store cryptocurrency private keys on internet-connected devices like computers or smartphones. They offer convenient access to digital assets, facilitating easy transactions through mobile, desktop applications, or web browser extensions.

Let's explore the pros and cons of software wallets, along with a review of some popular options.

*Pros of software wallets*

* *Accessible*  — software wallets provide easy access, allowing users to manage cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, perform transactions, and check balances quickly from any location with internet connectivity.

* *User-friendly* — these wallets typically feature intuitive interfaces, making it straightforward for users to navigate, conduct transactions, and monitor their holdings, catering to beginners and experienced users.

* *Cost-effective* — unlike hardware wallets, software wallets are generally free to download and use, making them appealing to those new to cryptocurrencies or with smaller holdings.

* *Integration with exchanges and other features* — many software wallets offer additional features such as integrated exchanges, staking, and support for multiple cryptocurrencies, enhancing their functionality beyond mere storage.

*Cons of software wallets*

* *Security risks* — an internet connection makes software wallets more vulnerable to online threats, including hacking, phishing attacks, and malware. Users must ensure their devices and networks are secure.

* *Device dependence* — if the device hosting the wallet is damaged, lost, or compromised, accessing the wallet can be challenging without proper backup and recovery measures.

* *Vulnerability to malware* — devices infected with malware pose a significant risk to software wallets, potentially leading to unauthorized access and theft of digital assets.

When choosing a software wallet, consider factors like supported currencies, security features, ease of use, and any specific functionalities that align with your cryptocurrency usage habits.

==== Paper wallets

Paper wallets(((paper wallets))) are a form of cold storage for cryptocurrencies and digital assets -- i.e. they remain disconnected from the Internet and therefore are not vulnerable to online hacking attacks. A paper wallet is a physical document containing all the necessary data for accessing and managing digital assets. This document typically includes a public address (used by others that want to send funds to the wallet) and a private key, which allows the owner to access and transfer funds in the specific wallet.

Let's explore the advantages and disadvantages of paper wallets, along with some standard practices in the blockchain realm for effective management.

*Pros of paper wallets*

* *High security*  — since they are offline, paper wallets are immune to online hacking attacks, malware, and other digital threats, making them one of the most secure methods of storing cryptocurrency.

* *Ownership control* — with a paper wallet, you have complete control over your private keys and, consequently, your cryptocurrency and digital assets. There's no reliance on third-party services or risks associated with online wallet providers.

* *Cost-effectiveness* — creating a paper wallet is free, requiring only paper and a printer, unlike hardware wallets, which can be expensive.

*Cons of paper wallets*

* *User-friendliness* — paper wallets can be less user-friendly, particularly for individuals unfamiliar with blockchain technology. The process of transferring funds to and from a paper wallet is more cumbersome than using software or hardware wallets.

* *Durability and loss risk* — paper is prone to wear, tear, damage, and loss. If the paper wallet is damaged or lost without a backup, the funds stored on it become irretrievable. Remember, if someone steals your paper wallet they can then withdraw all assets stored in the digital wallet!

* *Lack of flexibility* — paper wallets offer a different level of convenience compared to other wallet types. They're best suited for long-term storage rather than for frequent trading or spending.

Next, we will review some standard methods for generating a paper wallet.

*Standard practices to create and manage a paper wallet*

The following practices are _general_ recommendations intended for informational purposes only.

* *Using a software or hardware wallet* — a common practice for generating a paper wallet is to create a pair of public and private keys using secure software or hardware wallets. After these keys are generated, the public key can be printed on paper for future reference. If needed, a QR code can be created to represent each key.

* *Using a trusted paper wallet generator* — some websites, such as link:https://www.bitaddress.org/[BitAddress.org], allow the creation of paper wallets. However, some of these websites have been flagged as insecure and potentially malicious. When using this mechanism, ensure you use a secure, trusted website to avoid malicious code.

* *Offline generation* — for enhanced security, the paper wallet should be generated offline on a computer that is not connected to the internet and has never been connected, to prevent exposure to online threats.

* *Secure printing* — the wallet should be printed with an offline printer to avoid any digital traces of your private keys. Using a printer that doesn't retain memory or a brand-new printer is advisable.

* *Safe storage* — once printed, the paper wallet should be stored in a safe, waterproof, and fireproof location. Some users opt for safes or safety deposit boxes. Creating multiple copies and storing them in different secure locations is also wise.

* *Avoid sharing* — never share your paper wallet's private key or QR code with anyone. Exposure equals potential theft.

* *Transferring funds* — when you want to move digital assets in a paper wallet, you will need to import your private key into a software wallet to conduct transactions.

When created and stored correctly, paper wallets offer a high-security option for storing cryptocurrencies and digital assets. They are particularly suited for long-term investors who wish to keep their digital assets securely without the need for regular access or trading. However, the potential risks of physical damage, loss, and the technical challenges of using paper wallets should be carefully considered.

==== Public and private keys in the context of wallets

Understanding the role of public and private keys is fundamental when using a wallet to manage digital assets. Public and private keys are like the username and password to your online bank account, but with some particularities that we will discuss.

*Public keys*

Think of the public key(((public key))) as your home address. Just like you can share your address with friends so they can send you letters or packages, you can share your public key with others to receive cryptocurrency or any other digital assets. It is a string of letters and numbers derived from your private key, but it is safe to share with others because, while it can receive funds, it cannot be used to withdraw any funds.

Imagine selling lemonade and asking people to leave money in a locked box at your front door (your public key). They can deposit money, but only you can unlock the box to retrieve it because you have the key – your private key.

*Private keys*

The wallet private key(((private key))) is like the key to that locked box. Like a public key, it consists of a string of letters and numbers, but should always be kept secret since it allows you to access and control your assets. With your private key, you can send your cryptocurrency and digital assets to others, sign transactions to prove you own the assets, and even access your funds if you switch to a new wallet.

Following the example of selling lemonade, you only hold the key to the padlock, allowing you to open it and retrieve the money left by customers. If someone else gains access to your key, they can take all the money, just as obtaining your private key enables unauthorized access to your cryptocurrency.

Public/private key pairs facilitate transaction processing and approval. The public key serves as the address for sending or receiving funds, while the private key is the secret that controls access to personal assets. Securing your private key is crucial because anyone with it can access your assets. Just like you wouldn't share the key to your safe with strangers, you should never share your private key with anyone.

==== Wallet addresses

A wallet address(((wallet address))) is similar to an email address or a home address – it is a unique identifier used to receive funds. When someone sends you cryptocurrency or other digital assets, they send it to your wallet address.

A wallet address is a string of letters and numbers that represents the destination for a blockchain transaction, involving the transfer of assets from one address to another. It's generated based on the public key and, depending on the blockchain, goes through a series of cryptographic transformations to create a shorter, more user-friendly address.

Below are examples of what wallet addresses look like for Cardano, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. Each of these addresses is a string of characters that includes numbers and letters, both uppercase and lowercase, specific to the blockchain they belong to:

*Cardano (ada) address:*

----
addr1q9d7n2g0s8eqrakj7k65zm4u6gfvvg4t5u9yvl5cxxxxxxxsyqgp7ytwx8x5a2hxu2zddm09fjq9usu2kyxj6h2c429sxxfcke
----

Cardano addresses start with the _addr1_ prefix and are longer than those of Ethereum and Bitcoin, reflecting the network's unique addressing scheme.

The length of a Cardano address can vary, primarily because it utilizes the _Bech32_ address format, which can be adjusted depending on the specific use case and the data it encapsulates. Typically, a Cardano address is about 58 to 103 characters long.

*Ethereum (ETH) address:*

----

Ethereum addresses begin with _0x_, a common prefix denoting hexadecimal encoding, and are 42 characters long, including the prefix.

*Bitcoin (BTC) address:*

Bitcoin addresses start with _1_, _3_, or _bc1_ for different address formats; the example shows one of the most common types, beginning with _1_.

Please note that these addresses are provided as examples only and should not be used for actual transactions. Each cryptocurrency wallet generates a unique set of addresses for the specific user, ensuring the security and privacy of the assets.

[[create-wallet]]
==== Creating a wallet address

The process of creating a wallet address may vary depending on the blockchain, but the following steps are generally followed.

. *Key pair creation* — a private key is first generated using cryptographic algorithms. This private key is a random, long string of numbers and letters that's (virtually) impossible to guess. Next, a public key is derived from this private key using another set of cryptographic rules.

. *Hashing* — the public key is then passed through a hashing algorithm – a cryptographic function that converts data into a fixed-size string of characters. This process helps enhance security and privacy.

. *Formatting* — after hashing, the result undergoes additional transformations, including the addition of a network identifier (which helps differentiate between different cryptocurrency addresses) and a checksum (which helps detect errors in the address). The final output is your wallet address.

Once it is created, a wallet address has a set of common characteristics regardless of the blockchain:

* *Uniqueness* — each wallet address is unique, ensuring that funds sent to the address reach the correct recipient.

* *Anonymity* — while wallet addresses are publicly visible on the blockchain, they do not reveal the owner's identity directly.

* *Single use* — for enhanced security and privacy, it is often recommended that you use a new address for each transaction. Many modern wallets automatically generate a new address after each transaction.

A wallet address is a critical component of cryptocurrency transactions, serving as a pointer to where funds should be sent on the blockchain. In short, it's derived from the public key through a series of cryptographic processes, ensuring security and facilitating the seamless transfer of digital assets.

The following section explores wallets available in the Cardano ecosystem.

=== Wallets in the Cardano ecosystem

Cardano wallets are designed to store, send, and receive ada, the native currency of the Cardano blockchain. These wallets are designed to support Cardano’s unique features, offering users a secure way to manage their assets. Let's break down the specifics of Cardano wallets in a simple and understandable way.

==== Cardano wallets are designed for ada

Firstly, it is crucial to understand that Cardano wallets are specifically designed for the ada cryptocurrency. Even though you can have a wallet that allows you to store assets from different blockchains, it’s important to highlight that, just like you might have a specific wallet or pocket for coins or cards, Cardano wallets are made to handle the particular requirements and features of ada and the Cardano blockchain.

==== Types of Cardano wallets

The Cardano ecosystem has two types of wallets: full-node and light wallets. Let’s examine them briefly.

*Full-node wallets*

Full-node wallets(((full node wallet))) download the entire Cardano blockchain to your device, offering high security and privacy since they do not rely on a third party to fetch blockchain data. Using a full-node wallet is like having a detailed map of an entire city. You can see every street and building, or, in this case, every transaction on the Cardano network.

A full-node wallet performs several key functions:

* _Transaction verification_ — verifies the validity of each transaction against the blockchain's consensus rules.

* _Blockchain synchronization_ — downloads and synchronizes with the entire history of the Cardano blockchain, ensuring it has the most up-to-date information.

* _Network participation_ — helps the network by relaying transactions and blocks to other nodes.

* _Security and privacy_ — by not relying on external sources for transaction verification, it offers its users increased security and privacy.

An example of a full-node wallet is the link:https://daedaluswallet.io/[Daedalus wallet]. It allows users to fully participate in the network, including sending and receiving transactions, staking ada for rewards, and interacting with smart contracts, such as those written in Plutus, Aiken, or Marlowe programming languages.

*Light wallets*

A light wallet(((light wallet))), also known as a lightweight wallet, does not download the entire blockchain. Instead, it relies on other nodes in the network to provide the necessary information to manage the user's funds and assets. Light wallets are much faster to set up and require less storage space than full-node wallets.

Using a light wallet is similar to using a map app on your phone. You don't need to download every map detail, but you can still find your way around.
Light wallets, such as Lace or Yoroi, allow users to interact with smart contracts without the need to run a full node. They can create transactions, sign them, and broadcast them to the network for execution. These wallets are handy for everyday users who want to engage with blockchain transactions without the technical overhead of maintaining a full copy of the Cardano blockchain.

The wallets in the Cardano ecosystem are constantly evolving, so the list is not exhaustive. For a current list of the wallets available in Cardano, you can look at community websites like link:https://builtoncardano.com/[BuiltOnCardano] or link:https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/new-to-cardano/types-of-wallets[the Cardano documentation page about wallets].

==== Staking and delegation

Cardano wallets offer a unique feature called staking and delegation. By staking your ada within the wallet, you can participate in the network's operation and earn rewards. Think of it like putting your money in a savings account where it earns interest, but in this case, you're helping to secure the network and validate transactions.

Staking and delegation are two key concepts in proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains, such as Cardano, which utilizes a variation called Ouroboros.

_Staking_ refers to the process of holding funds in a wallet to support the operations of a blockchain network. Essentially, it involves locking cryptocurrencies to receive rewards. Note that Cardano offers its users liquid staking, allowing them to spend their funds at any time. In PoS blockchains, staking contributes to the network's security and governance because the staked coins are used to select validators who confirm transactions and create new blocks.

_Delegation_, on the other hand, is the act of entrusting your staking power to a stake pool, a server node that maintains the network and processes transactions. Delegation allows wallet holders to participate in the staking process without running a node themselves. By delegating their stake, users can earn rewards proportional to the amount of cryptocurrency they delegate.

==== Security features

Security is a top priority for Cardano wallets. They are equipped with various security features to ensure your ada and other assets are safe from unauthorized access. Here are some of the Cardano wallets’ vital security features:

* _Encryption_ — wallets use strong encryption to protect private keys and other sensitive data stored on the user's device.

* _Seed phrases_ — wallets generate a recovery seed phrase, typically 12 or 24 words long, which can be used to restore the wallet and its contents on another device if the original device is lost or damaged.

* _Password protection_ — users can set a password to access the wallet application, adding an additional layer of security.

* _Cold storage_ — some wallets offer the ability to store funds offline, which is known as cold storage. This dramatically reduces the risk of online hacking attempts.

* _Multi-signature support_ — specific wallets support multi-signature configurations, which require multiple parties to sign a transaction before it can be executed. This enhances security for larger funds or organizational use.

* _Hardware wallet integration_ — many Cardano wallets can integrate with hardware wallets, such as Ledger or Trezor, which store the user's private keys in a secure hardware device, making them less susceptible to computer viruses and malware.

* _Transaction confirmation_ — wallets require user confirmation for transactions, ensuring that funds are not moved without explicit user permission.

* _Open source_ — many Cardano wallets are open source, allowing the community and security experts to review the code for potential vulnerabilities.

* _Regular updates_ — wallet developers regularly update the software to address any security issues and add new features, keeping the wallet secure against evolving threats.

==== Integration with DApps

Some Cardano wallets allow you to interact with decentralized applications (DApps) built on the Cardano blockchain. This feature allows for more versatile use of your ada, such as participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms or trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

==== A comparison of Cardano wallets and other blockchain wallets

Cardano wallets are designed specifically for the Cardano blockchain. They are tailored to interact with their unique features, such as the Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, native tokens, and smart contracts written in Plutus, Marlowe, or other supported programming languages.

Next, we present some notable distinctions between Cardano wallets and wallets for other blockchains.

* _Consensus mechanism compatibility — Cardano wallets support staking and delegation using the Ouroboros protocol, unlike proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin._

* _Extended UTXO model_ — Cardano employs an extended unspent transaction output (EUTXO) model, a variation of the UTXO model used by Bitcoin. Cardano wallets are designed to handle the additional complexity and capabilities of the EUTXO model, including the ability to process multiple assets in a single transaction.

* _Native token support_ — unlike other wallets that require smart contracts to handle tokens, Cardano wallets support native tokens, which do not require smart contracts, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of token transactions.

* _Smart contract integration_ — Cardano wallets can interact with smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain, including those written in Plutus or Marlowe, for example. This integration enables users to participate in complex financial contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).

* _Minimum ada requirement_ — transactions on the Cardano network require a minimum amount of ada to be included in the transaction to be valid. Cardano wallets automatically handle this requirement.

* _Network upgrades_ — Cardano undergoes regular network upgrades, known as hard forks, which are seamlessly integrated into the wallets without disrupting the user experience.

* _Security features_ — many wallets share standard security features, such as encryption and seed phrases. Cardano wallets, however, often include additional measures tailored to the Cardano ecosystem, such as leveraging the Ouroboros protocol – the backbone of Cardano's security and consensus mechanism.

* _Community and governance_ — Cardano wallets may include features that allow users to participate in the Cardano community governance, such as voting on Project Catalyst proposals.

It's essential to note that, while there are differences, there are also many similarities between Cardano wallets and other blockchain wallets, including the basic functionality of sending and receiving funds, the use of public and private keys, and a strong emphasis on security.

Finally, not all wallets implement the complete set of features described above, but they provide a robust framework for securely managing ada. Remember, securing your recovery phrases and practicing safe wallet use is essential.

For a comprehensive list of wallets, please refer to link:https://developers.cardano.org/showcase/?tags=wallet[the wallets showcase in the Cardano Developers Portal].

==== Exploring Cardano wallets

This section discusses some of the wallets designed explicitly for the Cardano ecosystem, providing an overview of the available options.

===== Full-node wallets

Remember that when opened, a full-node wallet downloads the entire blockchain, requiring specific software and storage. Let’s discuss Daedalus, the full-node Cardano wallet available on the market.

Daedalus is one of Cardano's official wallets developed by IO. Daedalus is an open-source desktop software wallet for storing ada. As a full-node wallet, Daedalus downloads the entire Cardano blockchain, verifying every transaction to ensure maximum security.

The main features of Daedalus are:

===== Light wallets

While full-node wallets keep a copy of the entire Cardano node, a light wallet does not need to download the complete history of blockchain records. Instead, it links to a website where the full blockchain is accessed, making it faster and easier to use. Light wallets are usually distributed as browser plugins or mobile applications.

This section explores some of the most prominent light wallets in the Cardano space. As this is not a tutorial, the section only offers an overview of key features. However, links and learning resources are provided for each light wallet to explore further.

Let’s start our journey through the Cardano light wallet space!

*Lace*

Lace began life as a slim, browser-based wallet for Cardano, designed to make holding and sending ada as simple as opening a new tab. Fast-forward to its latest release, and Lace has evolved into a full-featured Web3 launchpad: it now supports main-net Bitcoin alongside ada and Cardano native tokens, integrates NFT management and one-click staking into the same clean interface, and replaces long wallet addresses with short, human-readable Handles. All of this is wrapped in an intuitive extension that installs on Chrome, Brave, Edge, or Firefox in seconds.

But Lace is more than a place to park your coins. Built-in governance tools enable you to cast votes or delegate voting power directly from your wallet. At the same time, a DApp connector drops you straight into DeFi, games, and marketplaces across the Cardano ecosystem. Add a fiat on-ramp, bundled transactions to save on fees, and optional Nami-mode compatibility for older dApps, and Lace becomes a single, lightweight gateway to staking, trading, collecting, and shaping the future of Cardano, as well as Bitcoin and Web3.

==== Sending and receiving digital assets on Cardano

Sending and receiving digital assets is the most common operation in blockchain wallets. On Cardano, you can manage and send various digital assets, including:

* *ada* — ada is the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano blockchain. It is used for transactions, staking, and paying transaction fees on the network.

* *Cardano native tokens (CNTs)* — with the introduction of the Mary upgrade to the Cardano blockchain, users can create and distribute their custom tokens. These tokens operate on the same blockchain as ada without needing smart contracts to handle the custom token logic. This feature enables the direct management and transaction of various assets through Cardano wallets.

* *Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)* — Cardano also supports the creation and exchange of NFTs, unique digital assets verified using blockchain technology that represent ownership of specific items or content, such as art and collectibles.

Cardano's design separates the data layer (where transactions are recorded) from the computation layer (where smart contracts are executed), allowing for efficient handling of different digital assets with reduced costs and improved speed. This makes Cardano wallets versatile tools for managing ada, native tokens, and NFTs within the same ecosystem.

Sending and receiving digital assets on Cardano involves a straightforward process that anyone with a Cardano wallet can perform. Below is the general process for sending and receiving ada or other CNTs, including NFTs, using any Cardano wallet.

*Initial requirements*

Before you can send or receive digital assets, you need a few essential components:

* A Cardano wallet — you must have a Cardano-compatible wallet, such as Daedalus, Lace, Nami, Yoroi, or another wallet that supports Cardano transactions.

* Wallet setup — ensure your wallet is appropriately set up. This includes installing and updating your wallet software and completing any necessary setup procedures, such as creating or restoring a wallet.

* Funds in wallet — to send ada or other tokens, you need to have enough ada in your wallet to cover the transaction and any associated fees.

* Recipient's address — to send assets, you need the recipient's wallet address. This should be a valid Cardano address provided by the person or entity to whom you’re sending assets.

Once your Cardano wallet is ready, you can send or receive digital assets as follows.

*Sending digital assets*

Here is the typical process for sending ada or other tokens from a Cardano wallet:

. Access your wallet — open your Cardano wallet application on your device.

. Enter the recipient's address — navigate to the send section of your wallet. Here, you'll need to input the recipient’s Cardano address accurately. Double-check this address to ensure you send assets to the correct person.

. Specify the amount — enter the amount of ada or the specific tokens you wish to send. If you are sending NFTs, you’ll select the particular asset from your inventory.

. Confirm transaction details — review the transaction details, including the recipient's address, the amount, and the transaction fee.

. Authorize and send — confirm the transaction, typically by entering a password or PIN, and, if applicable, approve the transaction using any additional security features, such as 2FA or a hardware wallet confirmation.

. Wait for confirmation — once sent, the transaction will be processed on the Cardano blockchain. You can check the status in your wallet or use a Cardano blockchain explorer to see when it has been confirmed.

*Receiving digital assets*

Receiving ada or other tokens is more straightforward and requires the following steps:

. Access your wallet — open your Cardano wallet.

. Locate your wallet address — navigate to the receive section of your wallet. You’ll find your Cardano wallet address, which you can copy here.

. Share your address — provide your Cardano address to the person or service from which you expect to receive assets. You can share this address directly or via a QR code, if your wallet supports it.

. Check for incoming transactions — once the sender initiates the transaction, you can monitor your wallet for the incoming funds. The assets will appear in your wallet once the blockchain confirms the transaction.

Following these steps, you can send and receive digital assets on any Cardano wallet. We encourage you to read the wallet’s documentation for detailed information on conducting these actions in a particular wallet.

==== Staking ada

Ada held on the Cardano network represents a stake in the network, with the size of the stake proportional to the amount of ada held.

Staking ada involves participating in transaction validation on the Cardano blockchain. By staking your ada, you support network operations and help verify transactions. In return, you earn rewards in additional ada, incentivizing participants to maintain network integrity.

An ada holder can earn rewards by delegating their stake to a stake pool or by running their stake pool. The amount of delegated stake influences the Ouroboros protocol's selection of who adds the next block and receives rewards.

The more stake is delegated to a stake pool (up to a certain point), the more likely it is to produce the next block and share rewards with its delegators.

===== Staking ada using a Cardano wallet

Staking ada using a Cardano wallet involves a few straightforward steps that allow you to earn rewards by participating in the network's consensus mechanism. Below is a detailed guide on how to stake your ada.

*Step 1: choose a compatible wallet*

First, you need a Cardano wallet that supports staking, such as Daedalus, Yoroi, or Lace. The example wallets are provided for informational purposes only and are not endorsed by the authors. Their use is strictly at your responsibility.

*Step 2: set up your wallet*

* Download and install your chosen wallet

* Create a new wallet or restore an existing one using the recovery phrase

* Secure your wallet by setting a strong spending password and backing up your recovery phrase in a secure location.

*Step 3: transfer ada to your wallet*

* If your ada is not already in your staking wallet, you should transfer it from where it’s currently held (another wallet or an exchange)

* Use the receiving address from your Cardano wallet to transfer ada into it.

*Step 4: choose a stake pool*

* Within your wallet, navigate to the staking section or delegation center

* Browse or search for stake pools; when selecting a pool, consider factors like:

* Reliability: the pool's uptime and performance history

* Fee structure: the amount that the stake pool charges for its services

* Pool saturation: a measure of how much ada is already staked in the pool; overly saturated pools may offer diminishing returns

* Rewards estimation: some wallets provide estimates of the rewards you might earn from staking with a particular pool.

*Step 5: delegate your ada*

* Select the stake pool to which you want to delegate.

* Delegate your ada by confirming the transaction in your wallet; to complete this process, you need to pay a small transaction fee in ada

* Once delegated, your ada remains in your wallet; you simply assign your staking power to the pool.

*Step 6: monitor and manage your staking*

* After you have delegated your ada, you can monitor the performance of your chosen stake pool directly through your wallet.

* Rewards are usually distributed automatically at the end of each epoch (every 5 days). These rewards will be added to your wallet balance and can be reinvested (re-delegated) to compound your holdings.

* You can change stake pools at any time if you find another pool that offers better returns or aligns better with your preferences.

*Additional considerations*

* Stay informed — monitor your stake pool's performance to maximize returns.

* Security — keep your wallet and recovery information secure. Never share private keys or recovery phrases.

Following these steps, you can effectively participate in staking ada, contributing to the Cardano network's security and decentralization while earning passive rewards. This process not only enhances the stability of the Cardano ecosystem but also offers its participants financial benefits.

==== Governance

Cardano wallets support governance actions within the ecosystem, particularly through the Project Catalyst initiative. This framework enables ada holders to propose, discuss, and vote on development projects that enhance the Cardano network.

Users can participate in this decentralized governance process using wallets like Daedalus and Lace. Wallets provide interfaces for accessing the Catalyst voting system, where users can register and cast votes directly.

This empowers the community to influence the network's future, ensuring development aligns with global user interests. By participating in governance through their wallets, ada holders help shape Cardano's evolution, fostering an inclusive and democratic blockchain environment.

You can read more about Cardano governance in the Governance chapter.
