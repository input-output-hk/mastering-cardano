=== Mithril in a nutshell

Mithril is a protocol and a network designed for proof-of-stake
blockchains that aims to provide lightweight access to blockchain data
with high security and decentralization (see the <<Mithril security>>
section). While the Cardano blockchain offers robust security, starting
a new node, syncing it with the network, or exchanging data can be slow
and resource intensive – requiring 24GB of RAM, 150GB (and growing) of
storage, and over 24 hours for initial synchronization. Mithril,
developed for Cardano as part of the Basho development phase, focuses on
optimization, scalability, and interoperability. Practical use cases for
Mithril include data synchronization for light and full-node wallets and
data exchange with layer 2 solutions (such as bridges, sidechains,
rollups, and state channels).

The Mithril protocol design is based on the following core ideas:

* Leveraging stake to efficiently certify data within a large committee of
signers
* Ensuring a transparent setup without increasing trust requirements.
Security is guaranteed through a trusted Genesis phase for Mithril,
similar to Cardano’s.

Mithril achieves its goals using a stake-based threshold multi-signature
(STM) scheme developed by the Input | Output (IO) research and
engineering teams and presented in the
https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/mithril-stake-based-threshold-multisignatures/[Mithril
research paper]. Simply put, the scheme generates a certificate to
prove that a minimum representative portion of signers – selected based
on their stake – has signed a specific piece of data (here referred to
as the message).

Unlike other schemes where communication complexity increases
exponentially with the number of signers, Mithril employs a lottery
mechanism to select a subset of signers. The probability of selection is
proportional to the stakeholders’ stake, ensuring efficient
participation. The selected signers produce signatures that an
aggregator combines into a Mithril multi-signature, which can only be
produced when a predefined threshold (quorum) of the total stake has
contributed. No interaction is required between signers, and the
communication complexity is sublinear. A verifier can then efficiently
check the multi-signature without relying on the aggregator that
provides the multi-signature.

The Mithril network is the practical implementation of the Mithril
protocol. Network nodes take the aforementioned roles: _signer_,
_aggregator_, and _verifier_ (also known as the client), as well as
other security-related roles such as the relay.

=== The Mithril protocol (advanced)

Mithril enables a multi-party signing process by holding a pre-defined
number of lotteries (*m*) run by all signers when signing a message. A
multi-signature is generated once the number of unique winning lottery
indices from the signers reaches a threshold (*k*) – the quorum. The
probability of a signer winning a lottery is proportional to their
stake. It is influenced by a tuning parameter (*f*), which represents
the success probability assigned to the maximum stake weight or the
total protocol stake. Note that this process can lead to a single signer
winning multiple lottery indices for the same message.

The Mithril protocol has three phases:

* *Protocol establishment*, during which the protocol parameters for all
the Mithril participants (signers and aggregators) are selected
* *Initialization*, during which the set of participating Mithril
signers generate and broadcast keys
* *Operation*, during which the set of participating Mithril signers
create and broadcast individual message signatures, and Mithril
aggregators produce message multi-signatures.

*Protocol establishment phase*

In this phase, three important protocol parameters are selected:

* *m*, the number of lotteries a single signer can participate in to sign
a message
* *k*, the minimum required number of unique lottery indices gathered
from individual signatures to create a multi-signature
* *f (or phi_f)*, a tuning parameter that adjusts the probability of
signers winning a lottery based on their stake.

The protocol’s security directly depends on the values of these
parameters, which are carefully chosen to ensure a negligible chance of
an adversary forging a valid multi-signature. Details on the
relationship between these parameters and protocol security are provided
in the <<Mithril security>> section.

All network participants, including signers and aggregators, must
operate using identical protocol parameters. This protocol establishment
phase is conducted only once.

*Initialization phase*

This phase involves initializing each signer and registering their
cryptographic keys. First, the signer retrieves the protocol parameters
to generate a new key pair (verification key and signing key) along with
a proof of possession (PoP). The PoP proves that the signer owns the
secret key associated with the verification key being registered. The
verification key and PoP are broadcast to all parties for registration,
which takes place within a predefined period – one epoch (five days on
Cardano). The initialization phase repeats at the start of each new
epoch. The keys generated during this phase are used for signing two
epochs later.

For the protocol to work, all signers and aggregators must reach
consensus on the key registration process, which includes the
verification keys and the associated stake of the signers (referred to
as the Mithril stake distribution). Specifically, consensus must be
achieved among a subset of signers representing sufficient stake in the
protocol to ensure the quorum of signatures can be met.

Each party then computes a condensed representation of the key
registration process: the *aggregate verification key* (AVK). The AVK,
derived as the root of a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree[Merkle tree] created from
the verification keys and stake of the registered signers, is used to
create individual signatures and ultimately verify the aggregated
multi-signature.

*Operation phase* 

In the operation phase, signers generate individual signatures,
aggregators combine individual signatures into multi-signatures, and
verifiers confirm the validity of these multi-signatures.

During this phase, operations run in cycles triggered deterministically
on each party by the computation of a beacon, which depends on the type
of data to be signed. For example, a beacon might correspond to the
transaction set or UTXO set of the chain, signed every 20 blocks. Using
this beacon, each signer computes the associated message, which includes
the aggregate verification key, and attempts to sign it.

To do so, signers participate in a series of lotteries (*m*) against the
message to be signed and their stake (conducted in parallel), creating a
list of winning indices. If this list is not empty, signers combine it
with the cryptographic signature of the message (generated using their
signing key) into the individual signature. This individual signature is
then broadcast to the network for aggregators.

Upon receiving individual signatures from the signers, the aggregator
combines them into a multi-signature, provided that the quorum is
reached. The quorum is reached when the valid list of winning lottery
unique indices, extracted from the individual signatures, meets the
threshold (*k*). Such a multi-signature is then sealed into a Mithril
certificate along with the AVK.

Finally, a verifier can confirm the certificate’s validity by verifying
its multi-signature against its AVK. This verification requires a single
cryptographic pairing operation, which is fast.

The diagram below illustrates how a signer can create an individual
signature with Mithril. You can learn more about this process in the

a stronger and lighter blockchain for better efficiency] blog post.

=== The Mithril network

*Nodes* 

The Mithril network consists of multiple nodes, each with different
roles, to implement the signature and aggregation processes of the
protocol:

* The *Mithril signer* is responsible for producing individual signatures
* The *Mithril aggregator* collects individual signatures from the
*signers* and aggregates them into a multi-signature
* The *Mithril client,* both a library and a node, retrieves artifacts (eg
a Merkle proof or an archive file) and verifies that they are genuinely
signed by a Mithril multi-signature. The node version runs in a
WASM-compatible browser or as a standalone binary with a command-line
interface.

*Certified data types and their use cases*

*Mithril nodes* are jointly able to sign and create Mithril
multi-signatures for any information that can be computed
deterministically by each of them individually (the nodes need to
compute the same message to ensure successful aggregation). A specific
framework has been implemented for Mithril nodes to support the creation
of new types of certified data without impacting the core protocol code.
This provides flexibility and enables swift implementation. Below is a
list of data types currently implemented:

* *Cardano database*: the internal database of the Cardano node is
certified, enabling fast bootstrapping (a full node can be restored in
20 minutes!).
* *Cardano transactions*: the Cardano transactions set is certified,
allowing for the certification of a subset of transactions. This allows
light wallets to have a certification layer for transactions associated
with an address, eliminating the need to trust a third-party provider or
run a full Cardano node. The verification can even occur in the browser.
This also supports the implementation of ‘light clients’ for bridges,
enabling to monitor transactions on layer 1 smart contracts without
running a full Cardano node. This is also applicable to state channels
such as Hydra or rollups.
* *Cardano stake distribution*: the Cardano stake distribution is
certified at the transition to a new epoch. This enables the
verification of validator node stake in a bridge without running a full
Cardano node to access this data.
* *Mithril stake distribution*: the Mithril stake distribution (the stake
of the stake pool operators (SPOs) involved in the protocol and their
verification keys) is certified at the transition to a new Cardano
epoch. This mandatory information must be signed at each epoch to secure
the Mithril protocol, and is achieved through the *Mithril certificate
chain*.

*The certificate chain* 

The *Mithril certificate chain* is the component that certifies the
*Mithril stake distribution* used to create multi-signatures. Its
primary purpose is to prevent adversaries from executing an
https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-eclipse-attack[eclipse attack].

Without the certificate chain, the stake distribution can't be trusted.
A malicious actor could relatively easily create a fake stake
distribution and use it to produce a valid multi-signature, which would
be embedded in a valid but non-genuine certificate. This certificate
could be served by a dishonest Mithril aggregator node, leading an
honest Mithril client to trust a non-genuine information.

To certify the Mithril stake distribution used to create a
multi-signature, the distribution must be verified as having been
previously signed in a certificate from the previous epoch. Then, one
can recursively verify that the earlier certificate is valid in the same
manner. The first certificate in the chain has a special role, which is
discussed below. Also, the certificates are chained in such a way that
traversing them results in only one certificate per epoch, enabling fast
verification.

The first certificate in the certificate chain is known as the *genesis
certificate*. Validating the stake distribution embedded in the genesis
certificate is only possible by manually signing it with a private key
linked to a widely accessible public key, called the *genesis
verification key*. The use of these specific keys ensures the integrity
and security of the initial stake distribution and subsequent
transitions within the blockchain network. You can read more about the
certificate chain design and its verification algorithm in the official
documentation. A link is provided in the <<Additional resources>> section.

*Decentralization and peer-to-peer (P2P) networking* 

Ultimately, the *Mithril network* is designed to be fully decentralized.
However, the first implementation is centralized, as full
decentralization introduces complex subjects that are currently active
areas of research for the Mithril team:

* *Signer registration*: this protocol phase requires that a vast majority
of the signers and aggregators compute the Mithril cryptographic
operations on the same Mithril stake distribution. Currently, this is
being achieved with a centralized broadcast mechanism of signer
registrations by an aggregator. In a decentralized setup, an
implementation of this process could be very similar to the consensus
reached by block producers in a blockchain over a P2P network.
Implementing this is complex, which is why it is still under
development.
* *Signature diffusion*: this protocol phase requires the diffusion of
signatures from signers to aggregators over a network. This is currently
achieved with a centralized mechanism on an aggregator. In a
decentralized setup, the signature diffusion needs to rely on a P2P
network layer. https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0137[CIP-137] 
(Decentralized message queue) has been proposed to leverage the Cardano
network layer to operate the diffusion of signatures, incorporating new
mini-protocols.

=== Mithril security (advanced)

*Security of the cryptographic protocol*

Mithril security relies on the underlying security of the STM scheme.
The protocol leverages threshold multi-signatures, which enable the
aggregation of multiple individual signatures into a single compact
signature, depending on the distribution and control of stake among the
participants. The Mithri protocol relies on the following:

* *Threshold multi-signature*: a scheme in which individual signatures
from multiple participants are aggregated into a single signature if the
total stake of the participants exceeds a certain threshold.
* *Stake-based eligibility*: the protocol ensures that only participants
with sufficient stake are eligible to sign messages. This eligibility is
determined https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness[pseudorandomly].
* *Aggregation and verification*: individual signatures are aggregated
into a single multi-signature, which can then be verified efficiently.

The Mithril protocol realizes the *ideal functionality of a stake-based
threshold multi-signature scheme*. This means that an adversary cannot
create a valid multi-signature unless they control a significant portion
of the total stake.

The Mithril research paper mathematically demonstrates the protocol’s
security: it formalizes the security guarantee by showing that the
protocol realizes the ideal functionality under specific conditions,
relying on a computational hardness assumption and the collision
resistance of a hash function. The proof involves a series of hybrid
games comparing the real protocol with an idealized version to show that
the adversary's probability of success is negligible. The security proof
is supported by some lemmas:

* *Sampling property*: demonstrates that the probability of an adversary
winning enough lotteries to form a multi-signature is negligible.
* *Individual signature verification failure*: ensures that the
probability of a non-eligible user producing a valid signature is
negligible.

The Mithril protocol is designed to be secure against a wide range of
attacks, including those by adversaries with significant computational
power, control a significant portion of stake, or attempts to manipulate
the protocol through multiple identities or old stake. The security
goals are as follows:

* *Integrity*: ensure that only valid and legitimate participants can
generate multi-signatures, and that these multi-signatures accurately
reflect the consensus of the stakeholders.
* *Resistance to Sybil attacks*: ensure that the influence in the protocol
is proportional to the stake held, making it difficult for an adversary
to gain control through multiple fake identities.
* *Forgery resistance*: prevent adversaries from creating valid forged
individual signatures or multi-signatures.
* *Long-range attack resistance*: ensure that the old stake cannot be used
to create an alternate certificate chain capable of overwriting the
current one.

To ensure robust security and efficiency of the Mithril protocol,
*protocol parameters* must be cautiously selected - the choice of these
parameters directly influences the trade-offs between security and
efficiency:

* *Higher k and m values*: these increase security but require greater
computational and communication resources. This is suitable for
high-value transactions or networks with significant stake
concentration.
* *Lower k and m values*: these optimize efficiency and are suitable for
more distributed networks where the risk of attack is lower.

*Security of the certificate chain* 

The *certificate chain* certifies the *stake distribution* used to
create multi-signatures, embedding them in certificates that are chained
together to establish trust. Its primary purpose is to prevent
adversaries from executing an
https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-eclipse-attack[eclipse
attack]. The verification process is recursive, and a chain is
considered valid if, for each certificate in the chain (at least one
certificate per epoch is required as the stake distribution changes at
every epoch):

* The certificate itself is valid (the multi-signature is valid, and the
certificate hash matches its content).
* The AVK representing the stake distribution used to create the
multi-signature is either:
** Signed by a Mithril multi-signature in a certificate from the previous
epoch, which is referenced in the current certificate
** Signed by a genesis signature. In this case, the certificate is called
the *genesis certificate* – a one-time manual signature signed with a
secret key. The corresponding verification key (the genesis key) is
widely accessible to verifiers.

*SPOs participation*

Mithril security relies heavily on the participation level of SPOs and
the adversarial assumptions of the underlying stake-based Cardano
network. Achieving the protocol’s full security requires participation
representing nearly the entire Cardano stake.

*Threat model*

Mithril security is also tied to its implementation, which is currently
available in the https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/[Mithril repository]. 
The Mithril team has published a
https://mithril.network/doc/mithril/advanced/threat-model[*threat
model analysis*], which assesses the assets involved in the Mithril
network, identifies potential threats to these assets, and outlines
their mitigations to better understand the impact on the SPO
infrastructure and the Cardano chain.

*The present and future of Mithril*

The full implementation of the Mithril protocol is a work in progress,
with new capabilities and enhancements being progressively added. The
first version of the protocol was released on the Cardano mainnet in
July 2023, with a set of pioneer stake pools as participating signers,
enabling the certification of snapshots of the Cardano blockchain.
Mithril currently operates in a centralized setting, where the
aggregator, operated by the Mithril team at IO, takes additional
responsibilities, such as broadcasting signing keys and orchestrating
the signing process. Decentralization, increased stake pool
participation, the addition of certificates for new types of data, and
porting the Mithril client to new platforms and programming languages
are some of the features on the development roadmap. Furthermore, while
the current implementation targets the Cardano blockchain, it is
designed to work in any stake-based environment beyond Cardano.
