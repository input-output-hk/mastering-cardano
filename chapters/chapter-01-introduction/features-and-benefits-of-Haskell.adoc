=== Features and benefits of Haskell

Haskell(((Haskell))) is a general-purpose, advanced, purely functional programming
language. It achieves memory safety through garbage collection and
compiles to native code.

It has everything one would expect from a modern programming language:

* Language server protocol (LSP)
* Editor integration (VSCode, Vim, Emacs, etc.)
* A package system that manages dependencies and facilitates starting,
maintaining, and publishing Haskell projects
* A big community with over 16,000 published packages
* And more.

On top of that, Haskell has a unique set of features that make it a
one-of-a-kind programming language. Some features appeal to researchers
who want to explore the boundaries of what's possible with programming
languages, and others appeal to software engineers who want to build
production software. This section explains the features and benefits
relevant to people of the second group.

==== Purity and immutability

*Purity in Haskell*

Purely functional programming languages treat all computations as
evaluations of mathematical functions. In purely functional programming
languages, a function will always return the same value for a specific
input. This property is amazing because it ensures referential
transparency (the ability to replace functions with their definitions)
and significantly reduces the cognitive load(((cognitive load))) of the developer in
understanding the program.

Purity in Haskell is more nuanced. A completely pure program wouldn't
have any real-world effect and would be practically useless. On the
other hand, allowing side effects compromises the benefits of purity.
Haskell addresses this dilemma with an elegant and practical solution –
explicit effects(((explicit effects))).

In Haskell, effects are explicitly tagged using types. This offers
several benefits:

* The developer can write most of the code as pure functions, minimizing
exposure to effects
* The developer can selectively allow only the necessary effects
* Referential transparency and equational reasoning are maintained.

The benefit of this approach is profound in terms of reliability and
predictability. Because pure functions(((pure function))) do not depend on or alter any
state outside their scope, they are much easier to reason about. This
isolation simplifies debugging and testing, as each function can be
considered in isolation without concern for external dependencies or
hidden contexts.

*Immutability in Haskell*

Closely related to purity is the concept of immutability – another
cornerstone of Haskell. Immutability means that once a data structure(((data structure))) is
created, it cannot be changed. To modify a data structure, a new one
with the desired changes is created, leaving the original intact. While
this might seem like it would lead to performance issues, Haskell
efficiently manages structures under the hood, enabling the creation of
high-performance programs.

Immutability(((immutability))) eliminates a whole class of issues related to changing
states. In languages with mutable data structures(((data structure, mutable))), issues often arise from
unintended side effects where different parts of a program unexpectedly
alter shared data. In Haskell, those issues are impossible because all
data structures are immutable. Each component operates on its own data
without risk of interference, leading to safer and easier to comprehend
code.

*Benefits of purity and immutability*

[arabic]
. *Simplified reasoning*. With pure functions and immutable data,
understanding the flow and outcome of a program becomes more
straightforward. Each part of the program can be examined in isolation,
making it easier to model, design, and reason about.
. *Enhanced testability*. Testing in Haskell is often more straightforward
because there is no need to mock a global state or set up and tear down
test environments. Tests can be run in any order without interfering
with each other, reducing the chances of brittle tests.
. *Refactoring confidence*. Combining purity and immutability with a
powerful type system(((type system))), refactoring Haskell code is less risky because the
compiler's type checks(((type check))) ensure that changes do not introduce
inconsistencies. Additionally, the absence of side effects means that
changes in one part of the system are less likely to cause unforeseen
issues in others.

==== Rich static type system

Haskell's type system is a defining feature that distinguishes it from
many other programming languages. It is not just a mechanism for
checking correctness but a sophisticated framework that enhances every
aspect of software development, from design to maintenance.

Haskell employs a static type system(((type system, static))), which means that type checking is
performed at compile time rather than at runtime. It is also _strongly
typed_, preventing the misuse of data types without explicit
conversions. More impressively, it supports advanced features like _type
inference_, where the compiler can automatically deduce the types of
expressions without explicit annotations. It also includes _algebraic
data types_, enabling the construction of complex data structures that
can be checked at compile time.

Another powerful aspect of Haskell's type system is its support for
_type classes_ and _generics_. Type classes allow for the definition of
generic interfaces that different types can implement, facilitating
polymorphic functions(((polymorphic functions))) that can operate on any data type that supports a
certain set of operations. This feature significantly enhances code
reusability and flexibility.

Finally, if you need more power, Haskell supports advanced type-level
programming such as type families, generalized algebraic data types(((algebraic data type)))
(GADTs), data kinds, and much more. You can have as much flexibility and
precision as you need to define your domain and invariants.

*Benefits of Haskell's type system*

[arabic]
. *Early error detection*. Haskell performs type checks at compile time,
identifying many errors that other languages might only catch during
runtime. This early detection saves significant debugging and testing
time and reduces the risk of runtime failures.
. *Program correctness and safety*. Haskell's type system enforces
constraints on how functions and data are used, significantly reducing
the likelihood of issues, like type mismatches or unintended type
coercions. This strict enforcement helps ensure program correctness and
enhances overall software safety.
. *Documentation through types*. Types in Haskell serve as a form of
documentation. They enhance code clarity by defining the data types that
functions expect and produce. This clarity is invaluable for maintaining
existing code and onboarding new developers.
. *Facilitation of refactoring*. The robustness of Haskell's type system
makes refactoring a safer process. Developers can make substantial
changes to the internals of their code with confidence as long as the
code continues to compile. This confidence is crucial for the long-term
maintenance and evolution of software projects.
. *Aid in design*. The type system in Haskell not only checks code but
also aids in its design by enforcing a level of thoughtfulness about
data types and their interactions. This enforced rigor leads to
better-designed, more robust, and maintainable systems.

==== Lazy evaluation

Lazy evaluation, also known as call-by-need, is a pivotal aspect of
Haskell's execution model. Unlike eager evaluation (call-by-value),
where expressions are evaluated as soon as they are bound to variables,
lazy evaluation postpones this process. This means that when you define
a variable in Haskell(((Haskell))), you are effectively defining a promise to compute
its value when it's required.

The mechanics of lazy evaluation are facilitated through thunks(((thunks))), which
are essentially placeholders for expressions that have not yet been
evaluated. When a thunk is first accessed, Haskell computes its value
and then caches it for subsequent uses, ensuring that each expression is
evaluated at most once.

Lazy evaluation was the catalyst of many other language design
decisions, and it has an important role in the way the developer
structures the code. It allows developers to better express what they
want instead of how to obtain it. In other words, it facilitates
declarative programming(((declarative programming))).

*Benefits of lazy evaluation*

[arabic]
. *Efficient memory use and reduced computation*. By evaluating
expressions only when their values are needed, Haskell can be more
efficient with memory usage and avoid unnecessary computations. This
allows for more efficient data handling(((data handling))), especially with large or
infinite data structures(((infinite data structures))).
. *Ability to handle infinite data structures*. One of the most striking
advantages of lazy evaluation is the capacity to work with infinite data
structures. For instance, Haskell can effortlessly handle lists that, in
theory, never end because it only computes the elements as they are
required.
. *Increased modularity*. Laziness enhances modularity – the ability to
separate a program into distinct, interchangeable components. Developers
can write more general-purpose functions(((general-purpose functions))) and compose them in various
ways without worrying about performance overheads typical of such
abstraction in eager languages(((eager languages))).
. *On-demand computation*. Lazy evaluation fits naturally with scenarios
where not all the data might be needed. For example, if you're
processing a large dataset to find just one item or a specific pattern,
Haskell will stop processing as soon as it finds what it's looking for,
rather than processing the entire dataset.
. *Refinement of performance*. While lazy evaluation may sometimes
introduce inefficiencies due to the overhead of managing thunks, it can
also enhance performance when not all computations results are needed.
Developers can write clear and natural code, while Haskell's lazy nature
often optimizes performance behind the scenes.

==== Concurrency

Concurrency is a critical aspect of modern software development,
enabling programs to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, thereby
improving performance and responsiveness. With its unique features,
Haskell offers a particularly robust environment for building concurrent
programs.

*Haskell's concurrency model*

Haskell's concurrency model is built on the concept of lightweight
threads, which are managed by the Haskell runtime system(((Haskell, runtime system))) rather than the
underlying operating system. This model allows for the creation of a
large number of threads with minimal overhead, making concurrent
programming in Haskell both efficient and scalable.

Additionally, Haskell's concurrency is greatly enhanced by its support
for software transactional memory(((software transactional memory))) (STM). This mechanism simplifies
handling shared mutable states(((shared mutable states))) across multiple threads by managing
transactions on memory atomically in a way similar to database
transactions. This helps to avoid deadlocks, race conditions(((race conditions))), and other
common concurrency issues while facilitating composability(((composability))) and
modularity(((modularity))).

*Benefits of Haskell's approach to concurrency*

[arabic]
. *Simplicity and safety*. Haskell's pure functional nature significantly
reduces the complexity associated with concurrent programming. Since
most data in Haskell(((Haskell))) is immutable, many common concurrency problems,
such as race conditions and deadlocks, are naturally avoided. This makes
concurrent Haskell programs easier to write, understand, and maintain.
. *Efficiency at scale*. The lightweight nature of Haskell threads allows
programs to scale efficiently with the number of processor cores(((processor cores))). This
is particularly beneficial in environments where high performance with
parallel processing(((parallel processing))) is required.
. *Software transactional memory (STM)*. STM in Haskell abstracts the
complexity of mutexes and locks typically required in other languages.
It allows developers to write code that modifies shared memory in a
transactional manner, automatically handling conflicts and retries,
significantly simplifying concurrent algorithms' design.
. *Composability*. Concurrency primitives in Haskell are highly
composable, meaning they can be combined in various ways to achieve
complex concurrent behavior. This composability(((composability))) stems from Haskell's
modular nature and powerful type system(((type system))), ensuring that components
interact in well-defined ways.

==== Metaprogramming

Metaprogramming(((Metaprogramming))), the practice of writing programs that write or
manipulate other programs, is a powerful technique that can
significantly extend the capabilities and efficiency of software
development. With its advanced type system(((type system))) and functional purity,
Haskell offers a rich environment for metaprogramming.

Metaprogramming primarily revolves around two powerful features:
template Haskell and type-level programming(((type-level programming))). Each serves distinct
purposes and offers unique advantages.

[arabic]
. *Template Haskell*. This is Haskell's facility for compile-time
metaprogramming. With template Haskell, programmers can write code that
generates other Haskell code during compilation. It provides the ability
to perform complex compile-time computations, manipulate Haskell
abstract syntax trees(((abstract syntax trees))) (ASTs), and automatically generate boilerplate
code.
. *Type-level programming*. Haskell allows for computations and logic to
be embedded within types, leveraging its powerful type system(((type system))).
Type-level programming in Haskell can involve creating and using kinds
like type-level natural numbers or lists, and even performing type-level
computations. This capability is enhanced by extensions such as
[purple]#DataKinds# and [purple]#TypeFamilies#, which allow types to carry
more complex structures and behaviors.

*Benefits of metaprogramming in Haskell*

[arabic]
. *Code generation*. Template Haskell allows for the automatic generation
of code, which can significantly reduce the amount of manual coding
required and help avoid repetitive boilerplate. This is particularly
useful in large projects where consistency and reduction of manual
overhead are critical.
. *Sophisticated abstractions*. Type-level programming enables Haskell
programmers to define and use abstractions that are checked at compile
time, leading to safer and more robust applications. These abstractions
can encapsulate complex behaviors or constraints that the compiler(((compiler)))
verifies.
. *Richer type system*. Metaprogramming, especially through type-level
programming, enriches Haskell's type system(((type system))) by enabling the expression
of more nuanced and powerful type constraints and behaviors. This leads
to more expressive and precise type signatures that enhance code safety
and clarity.
. *Improved performance*. Metaprogramming often shifts some computational
work to the compile phase, enhancing runtime performance(((runtime performance))). By reducing
runtime checks and computations, the resulting program can run more
efficiently.
. *Dynamic behavior with static guarantee*. Metaprogramming in Haskell
allows for a mix of dynamic-like behavior (eg generating different
types(((type))) of functions and structures based on external inputs) while still
retaining the guarantees of a static type system(((static type system))). This
best-of-both-worlds approach offers flexibility without sacrificing the
benefits of static typing.
