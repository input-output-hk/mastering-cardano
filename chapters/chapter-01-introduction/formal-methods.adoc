=== The importance of program correctness for cryptocurrency ledgers

Guaranteeing correct behavior of cryptocurrency ledgers(((cryptocurrency ledgers))) implemented on
blockchain technology(((blockchain technology))) comes with a unique set of challenges. An
important one stems from the fact that such programs are distributed,
meaning that the users running the code participating in implementing
its behavior may have conflicting incentives, and the network(((network))) across
which they are communicating may be unpredictable. Testing blockchain
applications at scale presents a serious challenge. If issues are
discovered post-release, the process of fixing these issues in such
software(((software))) can be very slow and difficult, as it may be impossible to
deprecate existing code. It is particularly tricky to deal with past
exploits of existing vulnerabilities(((vulnerabilities))), which may have resulted in assets
being stolen, or even downtime(((downtime))) of the entire system. Another reason for
paying special attention to correctness, is, of course, that users'
assets(((assets))) are at stake.

High-assurance guarantees about the behavior of the Cardano platform(((Cardano platform)))
must be built in from the start, and persist throughout its lifetime.
Formal methods(((Formal methods))) (FM) are mathematically rigorous techniques for ensuring
program correctness(((program correctness))) that can provide such guarantees. This section will
summarize the impact of using FM on the software development process(((software development process))),
specifying when it is appropriate to apply FM(((FM))). Specific FM(((FM))) techniques,
with a focus on FM(((FM))) in Cardano are also covered.

==== What are formal methods?

The formal methods approach provides guarantees of program behavior(((program behavior)))
correctness. It involves the application of symbolic logic(((symbolic logic))) to construct
behavior specifications(((behavior specifications))), define their properties, then verify, prove, or
property-test(((property-test))) those properties. There are many different FM techniques,
and a variety of tools.

A formal specification(((formal specification))) is a description of what a given program (or a
programming language) does, ie its semantics, written in symbolic logic
and mathematical notation. It may consist of a definition of how the
program state (eg a ledger or smart contract state) is updated in the
presence of some input(((input))). In the case of blockchain, such input(((input))) can be
clock ticks, incoming messages(((incoming messages))), blocks, or transactions. To consider a
non-blockchain example, a _counter_ program may have a state that is a
natural number, and to apply an incoming increment request(((increment request))), the counter
is incremented.

A property is a statement about program behavior(((program behavior))), for example, 'when two
increment requests arrive, the counter must be incremented twice'. A
proof is indisputable logical evidence(((logical evidence))) of the truth of a given property,
regardless of all external circumstances. Whenever these symbolic logic(((symbolic logic)))
formalisms (specifications, properties(((properties))), proofs, etc) are programmed and
checked using software(((software))), they are _mechanized_.

==== What do formal methods give us?

The use of FM(((FM))) does not guarantee some abstract notion of 'perfect
program correctness(((program correctness)))' of the resulting implementation. Rather, applying
formal methods means answering the following questions for a specific
piece of software(((software))) being developed, which help get closer to an
implementation that has high-assurance guarantees(((high-assurance guarantees))) with respect to
certain behavior properties(((properties))):

[arabic]
. What is the scope of the specification?
. What is the specification?
. How to be sure that our formal specification is really what we want?
. How to show that the implementation also satisfies this specification?

(1). A formal specification(((formal specification))) rarely models the entire piece of software
that will be implementing it. Multiple specifications may be required
for a given piece of software. For example, the Cardano platform(((Cardano platform))) has
separate specifications for networking(((networking))), consensus, ledger, and smart
contract layers. The scope(((scope))) may be further limited by omitting certain
functionality(((functionality))). For example, the ledger specification may leave the
details of the signing algorithm(((signing algorithm))) abstract, giving only an API, or leave
out the specifics of transaction serialization(((transaction serialization))) entirely. It is essential
to be clear about the scope(((scope))) of what is being specified. A reasonable
scope is one where there are no unpredictable external side-effects(((external side-effects))),
constraints(((constraints))), or inputs that are not accounted for in the specification.

(2). An FM engineer builds a formal specification(((formal specification))) by thinking really
hard about what they want the program to be doing, sometimes starting by
analyzing an informal specification(((informal specification))) or a requirements list. For example,
when a transaction is applied to the ledger(((ledger))), its validity is checked.
The definition of transaction validity(((transaction validity))) must be given using a formal
specification. This includes details such as 'does the validity interval(((validity interval)))
`[a, b]` of a transaction include the endpoints `a` or `b`?', or ‘does a
transaction need to specify the exact set of keys that must sign for it
to be valid?. There is not necessarily a 'correct' way to fill in these
details - decisions must be made by the engineers or stakeholders(((stakeholders))) in a
way that is consistent and suitable for the relevant use cases.

(3). Desirable properties(((properties))) of a program are defined to specify how the
program is expected to behave in specific situations. These properties(((properties)))
are not an obvious outcome(((outcome))) of the specification. They are the result of
FM engineers(((engineers))) thinking 'what do we want to guarantee about this program's
behavior?'. For example, 'the cost and outcome(((outcome))) of smart contract
execution is predictable locally' is a unique and cherished property of
Cardano smart contract execution(((smart contract execution))), and is not necessarily shared by other
blockchains. Upon formulating the desired properties(((properties))) of the program,
they need to be either proved or demonstrated with a high degree of
assurance, if possible. If it turns out that the specification does not,
in fact, satisfy the property, changes to the specification may be
required.

Despite the fact that it is not possible to prove(((prove))) – or even list – every
single desirable property of the behavior of a given program, this
approach results in many important guarantees, as well as helps
engineers find bugs in the process – usually way before deployment(((deployment))).

(4). A specification is commonly written using either no software(((software))), or a
different programming language(((programming language))) from the one in which the implementation
is written. Whenever a specification is written as a text document(((text document))), a
human must manually check that the specification and implementation(((implementation)))
match. When a specification is mechanized(((mechanized))), it may be possible to
establish conformance testing(((conformance testing))) between the two. This automates the
comparison between the outputs of the specification and implementation(((implementation)))
programs for a given set of states and inputs, making conformance
testing very useful for keeping the two codebases(((codebases))) synced.

==== FM techniques used in building the Cardano platform

To answer each of the questions posed above, different techniques are
applied in Cardano, tuning the level of formal rigorto the particular
use case. The most prevalent FM(((FM))) technique within Cardano is the use
of _type systems_. A type(((type))) system is a set of rules that assigns a
symbolic property of _type_ to each term, eg `5` is an `Integer(((Integer)))`, `[1 ; 2]` is
a `List Integer(((List Integer)))`, `True` is a `Boolean`, etc. A type system can provide such
guarantees as 'all items in this list are integers', or 'it is not
possible to add an integer and an error'. A strong type(((type))) system can
provide strong formal guarantees, so, to quote Simon Peyton Jones(((Peyton Jones, Simon))), type
systems are 'the most successful formal method'.

Strong type systems are famously helpful in refactoring code(((refactoring code))). This
is because changing the type of a variable or a function's input(((input))) or
output often results in compilation errors(((compilation errors))) that will prompt the
developer to 'follow the types', ie to refactor all relevant parts of
the program until the type(((type))) system accepts it. This often coincides with
completion of the required refactoring. For example, if a developer
changes the output of some function to allow it to output an error, all
functions that call this one will have to also be refactored to account
for this additional possibility.

_Functional programming_, while not itself a kind of FM(((FM))) technique, is a
programming paradigm(((programming paradigm))) that facilitates writing programs that are highly
amenable to formal specification(((formal specification))) and verification, and is widely used in
core Cardano technology(((core Cardano technology))). The name functional is chosen because all such
programs consist of functions, in the mathematical or logical sense, ie

[source,shell]
----
    f : A -> B
    f (a) = …
----

where the input type is `A`, the output type(((output type))) is `B`, and `f` associates to
each term `a` of type(((type))) `A` a term `b` of type(((type))) `B`. For example, if `A = B`, we can
define `f(a) = a`, the identity function(((identity function))). In _pure_ functional programs,
there is no extra underlying state or input, such as user IO(((user IO))), or
variable bindings(((variable bindings))), available to `f` within the computation. This
significantly simplifies reasoning about the outputs of the function
given a certain input(((input))) (or set of inputs).

Haskell is the programming language(((programming language))) of choice for building the core
Cardano node technology(((Cardano node technology))), including networking, consensus, and ledger
components. It is functional(((functional))), has a strong typing system, and has been
around for several decades, boasting a dedicated user and maintainer
base. In fact, prior to using proof assistants(((proof assistants))) for specification,
Haskell(((Haskell))) was the language for writing both the specification and the
implementation(((implementation))), with the difference between the two being the level of
optimization(((optimization))).

_Semi-formal_, or non-machine-checked, techniques are also in use for
building Cardano, including specification and proofs in the form of text
documents. For example, for a given UTXO state(((UTXO state))) and transaction, symbolic
logic can express: 

* How the UTXO state will be updated by this transaction, and
* What properties a valid transaction has.

While doing FM(((FM))) manually is not as reliable as machine-checked
techniques, this more lightweight approach is still extremely useful.
The Shelley and 'Shelley with multi-assets(((Shelley with multi-assets)))' Cardano eras had ledger
specifications written in this format. Refactoring such specifications
to match changes in the implementation(((implementation))) is very difficult, as it relies
on extremely careful manual analysis rather than 'following the types'.

_Proof assistants_ are software(((software))) tools that assist with the development
of formal proofs and specifications. A proof(((proof))) assistant is made up of an
integrated development environment(((integrated development environment))) (IDE) and a programming language. For
a number of proof assistants, the supported programming language(((programming language))) is
dependently typed(((dependently typed))), functional, and treats propositions and logical
reasoning as first class citizens. They support constructing and proving
propositions(((propositions))), sometimes also supporting some degree of automation for
this purpose. They can be used to provide stronger guarantees about the
behavior of a given program as compared to type systems(((type systems))) that do not
support proof construction. Lean, Agda, Coq, and Isabelle(((Isabelle))) are all proof
assistants used for different purposes within Cardano. The choice of
assistant depends on a number of factors, such as available expertise(((expertise)))
across engineers, interoperability with other system components(((system components))), and
support for automation(((automation))).

For example, compare a simple data structure(((data structure))) implemented in both Haskell
and Agda. *Set* is a data structure(((data structure))) that contains a collection of
elements(((elements))) of the same type, and each element is unique in this
collection. In Haskell, uniqueness of elements(((elements))) is ensured by defining an
insertion procedure(((insertion procedure))) of an element `e` into a set `S` that does nothing
whenever `e` is already contained in `S`, guaranteeing that duplicates
do not exist in the collection. Developers then might either rely on the
fact that it is easy enough to define insertion correctly or add some
test cases(((test cases))). A set – as it is defined in Agda – is a pair of (i) a
collection of elements(((elements))), and (ii) a proof that there are no duplicates in
that collection. This makes it impossible to define a bad insertion
procedure that allows accidental element duplication(((element duplication))), which is a
stronger guarantee than provided by the Haskell implementation(((implementation))).

The use of proof assistants(((proof assistants))) in building Cardano has a good track record
for squashing potential bugs before they cause problems in production(((production))).
For example, in the process of encoding the preservation of value
calculation into a proof(((proof))) assistant, an engineer was not able to complete
the proof(((proof))) construction. The engineer then realized that it was due to an
incorrect assumption made about certain functions, and they were able to
fix the specification and the implementation(((implementation))) accordingly.

Guarantees obtained via testing(((testing))) alone are not as strong as those of
formal verification(((formal verification))), such as proofs. Specialized kinds of testing are,
nevertheless, integral to the impactful application of FM(((FM))). The behavior
of a specification is defined by constructing _properties_. If we have
defined the specification correctly, these properties(((properties))) will be true for
any execution of the program. The approach of using a proof(((proof))) assistant
might be too heavy-handed for certain applications, ie too difficult or
time consuming. Instead, special software(((software))) called _generators_ is used
for generating extremely large numbers of random valid execution traces(((random valid execution traces))),
and the desired property is then checked to hold for the generated
traces. Generators are tuned to provide better, more realistic coverage.
This approach is called _property testing_.

_Conformance testing_ is a specific type of property testing(((property testing))). It
provides high-assurance guarantees(((high-assurance guarantees))) that the behavior of the
implementation(((implementation))) for an arbitrary state and input matches the behavior of
the specification for the same state and input(((input))). Formally proving
equivalence between specification and implementation(((implementation))), especially when
the implementation(((implementation))) is optimized and written in a different language, is
quite unrealistic. Conformance testing(((testing))) is useful in formalizing certain
aspects of behavioral equivalence, and providing highly reliable (if not
indisputable) evidence to support these claims.

Finally, _specialized formal models_, such as DELTA-Q Systems
Development, have been developed to simulate reasoning about real
systems before they are implemented and tested. DELTA-Q enables up-front
performance modeling(((performance modeling))). Analysis using this tool can be carried out before
creating a prototype(((prototype))) to rule out infeasibility early on, and to give
realistic performance constraints(((constraints))). For example, it has been used for
excluding models that presume the existence of transatlantic network(((network)))
connections that are faster than the speed of light(((speed of light))).

Overall, developing new tools, such as the one described above, as well
as improving existing ones, is an important component of formal methods
application in Cardano, and in industrial contexts(((industrial contexts))) in general. Other
examples of tool development(((tool development))) work done as part of the Cardano
engineering include contributions to both Haskell(((Haskell))) and Agda
implementations.

==== Tuning the level of formality

Not all techniques listed above are suitable for all Cardano components.
The idea is to tune the approach to each component and apply heavier
techniques with a greater emphasis on verification(((verification))) to the more tractable
inner components, and apply a more lightweight approach (type-safety(((type-safety))), at
minimum) with a greater emphasis on testing the impure outer components(((impure outer components))).

The strongest formal guarantees can be specified and proved about the
_ledger_ and _smart contracts_ executed on it. This is because both of
these components are programmed in a pure way. Moreover, these
components are written in a way that allows users to locally compute (ie
before submission of a block or transaction) changes that a transaction
will make, or the output of a contract. Like the ledger(((ledger))) component, the
consensus layer comes with certain formally proved properties(((properties))) about its
specification. However, like the networking(((networking))) component, it must also deal
with concurrent computation(((concurrent computation))) and some unpredictability, so formal
verification(((verification))) is not always suitable here.

The networking layer(((networking layer))) is a component for which it is more difficult to
prove properties(((properties))), since it has to deal with the complexity of unreliable
communication. For this reason, it is instead subject to intensive
property-based testing(((property-based testing))). However, because it is leaning heavily on
concurrency for efficient operations, even testing(((testing))) proved challenging.
Dedicated packages, including a special concurrency control mechanism(((concurrency control mechanism))),
were developed to provide an additional layer of abstraction on top of
parts of the Haskell runtime system(((Haskell runtime system))) (RTS). The same code can then be
executed either by the Haskell(((Haskell))) RTS, or via a pure and fast
implementation(((implementation))) that deterministically simulates it, enabling excellent
testing(((testing))).

Additional off-chain components(((off-chain components))) are developed alongside Cardano, which
have sufficiently robust formal, statistical, and incentives-based
guarantees for the system to rely on them in its operation.

==== Formal methods process and its impact

Formal methods(((Formal methods))) establish a robust connection between research and
implementation(((implementation))). Research papers, together with the associated
proof-of-concept implementations(((proof-of-concept implementations))), are often difficult to transform into
realistic and efficient implementations. FM(((FM))) facilitates this process by
specifying exactly what the resulting implementation(((implementation))) has to do, while
maintaining the same level of scientific rigor(((scientific rigor))) as in the original
research(((research))) work. There are also some downsides to the use of FM, so let us
list the pros and cons of formal methods:

PROS: 

* Provide very strong guarantees about program behavior, such as the
absence (or a very low probability) of certain kinds of errors in all
program executions
* Multiple implementations built in accordance with a single formal model
are guaranteed to have the same functionality(((functionality))). 

CONS: 

* Requires a lot of time, resources, effort, and expertise
* May be difficult for non-experts to understand
* Tools are not always easy to use or production-ready
* Usually requires traditional testing to be done alongside proofs
* Difficult to adjust when software updates occur (and may be an
afterthought).

There is a common theme here – using formal methods is significantly
more difficult compared to traditional QA. However, the resource
investment (of time, funds, effort, etc) in FM(((FM))) has been worth it for
Cardano, which has been running with zero downtime(((downtime))) since its launch in 2017, at least
up to the time of publication of this book. Moreover, the core Cardano
technology has not endured any major hacks(((hacks))) resulting in the theft of
assets due to buggy implementation, and rigorous formal specification(((formal specification)))
and verification(((verification))) certainly deserves credit for this.

The Cardano node FM(((FM))) strategy has been a great help in achieving the
peace of mind that comes with strong guarantees about program behavior(((program behavior))).
Additionally, it helped establish a common language for communication
between researchers and practitioners(((practitioners))), provides a principled way of
adding new features, and serves as valuable reference material(((reference material))) for
future development.

A lot of FM research(((research))) and even application is done in an academic
setting. Making such work possible in an industry setting(((industry setting))) presents some
challenges, as mentioned in the CONS list above. To achieve optimal FM(((FM)))
usage in Cardano, FM work has been (i) mechanized(((mechanized))), eg including Agda
specifications and conformance testing(((conformance testing))), (ii) democratized, ie made more
accessible to a broader audience, including the Cardano community and
internal engineers(((engineers))), (iii) industrialized, ie has industry-like
development practices and standards, and (iv) modified to include a
broader scope of application of formal methods, eg cryptography(((cryptography))).

However, more work remains to be done in all of these areas. Further
verification of cryptographic protocols(((cryptographic protocols))) would be extremely valuable.
Work is ongoing on the application of formal methods in additional areas
of Cardano development, including compilation certification(((compilation certification))), running
verified code on-chain(((verified code on-chain))), and additional performance and security
modeling. Further work is also being done on tool improvement.
