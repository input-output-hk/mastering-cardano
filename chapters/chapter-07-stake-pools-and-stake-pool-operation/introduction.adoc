== Introduction

The strength of the Cardano network lies in its widespread and diverse distribution of stake pools, stake pool operators, delegators, builders, and community members at large. The ethos of this well-distributed network and broader ecosystem has found its way into the creation of this chapter.

While reading this chapter, you may notice that some of the sections were written in tones distinct from one another. This is not by accident. Since the Cardano network is maintained by excellent people from every corner of the Earth, it only made sense for this chapter to be written by some of the very best community members the Cardano ecosystem has to offer.

The intent of the _Stake Pools and Stake Pool Operations_ chapter is to deliver a thorough technical and conceptual overview of stake pool operation. For those new to Cardano, this chapter will give insight into what it takes to run and maintain a global, distributed network like Cardano. 

It is recommended that prospective stake pool operators read through this chapter, understand the concepts, then participate and practice operations on one or more of the publicly available testnets until sufficient expertise is met before spinning up on mainnet. Seasoned pool operators will hopefully be able to use this guide as a refresher, fill potential gaps in knowledge, and best of all contribute where needed. 

Some tools and guides are listed at the end of this chapter to assist with both learning how to operate stake pools and maintaining tight operations for long-term mainnet pools.
