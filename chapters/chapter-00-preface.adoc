These resources are carefully selected to provide you with opportunities to dive deeper into specific topics, understand the underlying theory, and stay current with the rapidly evolving Cardano landscape.

==== Why choose a reading path?

- Tailored learning — focus on what matters most to you, whether it's smart contract development, staking, network architecture, or dApp creation.
- Time efficiency — get up to speed faster by prioritizing key concepts and practical applications for your specific needs.
- Goal-oriented — each path is designed with a clear objective in mind, helping you achieve your learning goals more effectively.
- Flexible exploration — even if you follow a specific path, you can branch out and explore other sections as required.

=== Suggested reading paths
- _Cardano fundamentals path_ — ideal for anyone new to blockchain or Cardano, this path provides a solid foundational understanding of the Cardano ecosystem, its core principles, and its journey.
- _Smart contracts developer path_ — for developers eager to build on Cardano, this path guides you through the essential concepts and practical skills needed to write, test, and deploy smart contracts using Aiken and Plutus.
- _Cardano user path_ — for non-technical readers and blockchain enthusiasts, this path helps you understand the Cardano ecosystem, manage assets, explore NFTs, and engage with the community without delving into code.
- _Stake pool operator path_ — for readers whose goal is to learn how to run a node and start a stake pool, but are not necessarily interested in programming smart contracts or DApps.
- _Cardano governance and future path_ — for readers keen on Cardano's long-term vision, this path explores the principles of decentralized governance, the mechanisms for community decision-making, and the exciting future developments shaping the network.
