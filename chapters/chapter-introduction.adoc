== Introduction

The past years have seen many headlines touting how Blockchain, DLT, cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, NFTs, and DAOs (amongst others) will change society as we know it. Yet, to most people, what exactly these technologies are, what they mean to them, and how they will change society is unclear at best. Throughout this book we aim to both demystify what the technologies are but also provide readers with a starting point to developing such systems and decentralized applications (dApps). 

=== Where it all started, Bitcoin.

We start with the first proposal that sprouted this decentralized movement, Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto (who remains unknown to date) in a paper footnote:[​​Nakamoto, Satoshi. "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." (2008)] released in late 2008. The paper describes a novel (at the time) architecture built using a collection of techniques to solve the double spend problem -- a problem which had previously limited digital currency systems to those that required centralized servers or service providers. We now refer to systems that make use of these differet techniques as blockchain which is one type of distributed ledger technology (DLT).

Bitcoin's aim was to provide a digital currency system which did not rely on centralized service providers -- enabling individuals to send and receive digital currency without any intermediary, service provider, or authority who may be able to intervene or is required to approve transactions.

=== Blockchain and Smart Contracts

Blockchain, the collection of techniques that solve the double-spend problem, also provides a solution to creating digital systems that can execute code in a decentralized manner, where no single administrator, company, entity, owner, or other centralized party has control over the digital system upon which that code executes. Similar to how different software applications can be downloaded and run on computers to allow for computer to be used for many different things, code can be uploaded to a blockchain to allow for different uses of executing code in a decetralized manner. Code that is uploaded to a blockchain for decentralized execution are called smart contracts (we'll cover them in more detail later). 

Since smart contracts execute on a blockchain, this means that code can be executed in a manner that is tamper-proof and provides guarantees to all users that the system will do exactly what that code is written to do, without anyone having the ability to tamper with the system including its code and associated data. Given that developers can write code for different applicatios, smart contracts allow for blockchains to be used for so much more than just a means of sending and receiving digital currency, including the democratization of and access to financial services to anyone with an internet connected digital device (5 billion people at the time of writing), which includes over 600 million people that are unbanked. But it is not just about the democratization of financial services, other applications that have already been implemented and are being proposed include: decentralized property and land registries allowing for self-sovereign ownership -- ensuring that individuals do not lose their property just because a paper goes missing, or even if the land registry itself is destroyed; #**supply chain; self-soveirgn identity; digital assets NFTs and digital games; transparency and open processes in government and other entities; **#

Being decentralized, blockchain promotes openness and transparency, yet also privacy -- achieved through cryptography (which is a major building block of cryptocurrencies as the name implies). Personal details are not required for sending and receiving funds and neither to interact with other blockchain-based processes, while at the same time users can be validated, recorded, where required guarantees provided and logic based upon the interacting users executed -- all of this whilst preserving privacy.

=== A High-level Overview of a Blockchain System

A high-level overview of a blockchain system is presented in Figure #X# including:

    * _Users_ typically interact with blockchain systems in one of two ways: (i) by sending funds to a specified recipient; or (ii) when interacting with decentalised applications (dApps).
    * _Wallets_ are used to both store cryptocurrency, other types of tokens and assets and also to authenticate users. A wallet typically has: (i) a _public address_ which uniquely identifies the wallet and is used to specify the specific wallet when transferring funds to it; and (ii) a _private key_ which can be thought of as a password which is used to authorise transfers or any other interaction with the wallet. Wallets are implemented using asymmetric cryptography (discussed further in Chapter #2#).
    * _Nodes_, i.e. computers and other computational devices, collectively work together to keep the blockchain intact -- and that the rules of the system are not violated (e.g. that a user cannot spend more cryptocurrency than they have).
    * _Abstract Computer_ #include this?#
    * _Smart Contracts_, in a similar manner to software applications on traditional operating systems, allow for developers (and users) to write and run code on the blockchain as they deem necessary. They allow for blockchain systems to be used for much more than just what the blockchain inherently supports (e.g. transfer of cryptocurrency).

The blockchain, which is collectively maintained by the distribued nodes, from one perspective can be seen as an append-only ledger -- where new transactions (i.e. transfers and any interaction with smart contracts) are written to in an immutable manner forever.  At the same time, the blockchain must ensure that certain rules are upheld to ensure integrity of the ledger, such rules typically include that:

    * no one can spend more funds than they have;
    * no one can spend another person's funds (unless authorisation had been granted);
    * old transactions cannot be removed or edited; 
    * that any code uploaded in smart contracts execute exactly as written;
    * and that the ledger (which includes all history and current state of the system and smart contracts) is kept intact and that only one canonical version of truth should exist.
