== Cryptography

Cryptography is a fundamental building block of blockchain, DLT, smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. An overview of cryptography and its role in blockchain systems will be covered in this chapter. We do not go into technical details as it is beyond the scope of this book, but we point readers to other resources at the end of the chapter to dig deeper if interested.


=== Encryption techniques

Cryptography finds its roots in and is typically used for encrypting and decrypting information. It provides a way for parties to securely communicate without eavesdroppers being able to decipher or understand what has been communicated. 

Encryption techniques are classified into symmetric and asymmetric encryption. _Symmetric encryption_ uses the same _key_ to both encrypt and decrypt data.  In a similar manner to a physical lock the key is used both when locking and unlocking. More specifically when encrypting or decrypting. The digital key is shared amongst the different parties communicating. This requires that the key would have been shared in a secure manner typically using a different communication medium. Imagine an eavesdropper was listening to communication, and the first thing communicated is the key. If the communicating parties would then encrypt/decrypt information using the key, then they would be able to continue to eavesdrop and both decrypt messages as well as inject encrypted messages without any of the communicating parties knowing.

<<img_sym>> depicts how symmetric encryption would typically be used amongst two parties -- wherein _Party A_ wants to send encrypted data to _Party B_. The following notation is used in the diagram: the different steps in the process are denoted by a number in a circle; the solid line in Step 2 denotes communication between the parties; the dashed lines at the top denote some form of communication and agreement that takes place prior to the aforementioned communication; and the dashed lines represent actions that the parties undertake themselves (on their own computers). The steps involved in the process follow:
    
    * Step 0 typically takes place before the parties communicate over the medium that will be used to pass encrypted data. The parties must somehow agree on a shared encryption/decryption key. This key will be used both for encryption and decryption as discussed above. This key could be generated by _Party A_, _Party B_, or any other party and shared amongst Parties A and B. It is important to note that any party that has the specific key in their possession will be able to decrypt messages (as well as encrypt).

    * Once the sending party (in this case _Party A_) has the key, they can proceed to encrypt data to be sent to the other party by encrypting the data with the key using the symmertic encryption algorithm as depicted in Step 1. The algorithm will output the encrypted data.

    * Thereafter, _Party A_, the sending party, will transmit the encrypted data output from Step 1 to the intended recipient, _Party B_. Eavesdroppers will not be able to decrypt messages if the key is only known to Parties A and B, even if the encrypted data message is overheard by an eavesdropper footnote:[Provided that the encryption/decryption key strength is sufficient.].

    * Upon receiving the enrypted data, _Party B_, the receiving party, can decrypt the data with the key using the decryption algorithm.

Symmetric encryption is rather trivial to comprehend and implement since it makes use of a single encryption/decryption key. However, it does not provide any guarantees with respect to: 
    * being able to prove who sent a particular message -- i.e. any party can encrypt data and there's no way to know who sent the encrypted data; 
    
    * ensuring that communication intended for a particular party is only seen be that party.

The introduction of _asymmetric encryption_ in the 1970s provided a better solution to minimise potential eavesdroppers. It ensures that messages can only be decrypted by the party they were intended for and also a way to authenticate the sender of a message. Asymmetric encryption makes use of two keys (required by each recipient): 
    * a _public key_ belonging to the recipient which will be used by any party that wants to encrypt data intended for the specific recipient; 
    
    * a _private key_ which the recipient keeps private to themselves and can be used to decrypt messages sent to them that others have encrypted using the recipeint's public key. 

The public and private keys are intimately linked together (which is why they are termed a key-pair) and it is impossible footnote:[or rather computationally infeasible] to determine the private key from the public key.

An overview of how typical communication takes place using assymetric key encryption is depicted in <<img_asym>>. The main differences in the process are depicted in red, and a description of the steps involved in the process follow:

=== Hash algorithms

Encryption techniques discussed above provide a secure end-to-end means of digital communication yet do not provide a solution to guaranteeing that data (unencrypted or not) has not changed over time. Hash algorithms provide a solution towards this. Given any arbitrary data as an input, a hash algorithm will output a unique fingerprint, called a hash, for the specific data. No matter how many times the same exact input is passed in, the same hash (fingerprint) will be output. If even a single bit of the input data changes, the outputted hash will change drastically. This is a required feature of a hash algorithm, i.e. that it is impossible footnote:[again, computationally infeasible] to find some other data input that would result in the same hash.

Once a hash is generated, potentially sent, and ultimately stored somewhere, anyone that has a copy of the hash can be guaranteed that the associated data used to generate the hash, has not been changed. This is because the
