== Cryptography

Cryptography is at the heart and a fundamental building block of blockchain, DLT, smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. An overview of what cryptography is, what it provides and its role in blockchain systems will now be covered in this chapter. We do not go into internal details of how cryptography works as it is beyond the scope of this book, but at the end of the chapter we point readers to other resources to dig deeper if interested.


=== Encryption techniques

Cryptography finds its roots in and is typically used for encrypting and decrypting information -- providing a way for parties to securely communicate without eavesdroppers being able to decipher or understand what has been communicated. 

Encryption techniques are mainly classified into symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption. _Symmetric encryption_ uses the same _key_ to both encrypt and decrypt data.  It requires that the key is shared amongst the different parties communicating, and requires that the key would have been shared in a secure manner typically using a different communication medium. Imagine an eavesdropper was to listen in on communication and the first packet of data contains the encryption/decryption key -- they would be able to continue to eavesdrop and both decrypt messages as well as inject encrypted messages without any of the communicating parties knowing.

<<img_sym>> depicts how symmetric encryption would typically be used amongst two parties --- wherein _Party A_ wants to send encrypted data to _Party B_. The following notation is used: the different steps in the process are denoted by a number in a circle; the solid line in Step 2 denotes communication between the parties; the dashed lines at the top denote some form of communication and agreement that takes place prior to the aforementioned communication; and the dashed lines represent actions that the parties undertake themselves (on their own computers). The steps involved in the process follow:
    
    * At Step 0, which typically takes place before the parties communicate over the intended medium that will be used to pass encrypted data, the parties must somehow agree on a shared encryption/decryption key. This key will be used both for encryption and decryption as discussed above. This key could be generated by _Party A_, _Party B_, or any other party and shared amongst Parties A and B, however it is important to note that any party that has the specific key in their possession will be able to decrypt messages (as well as encrypt).

    * Once the sending party (in this case _Party A_) has the encryption/decryption key, they can proceed to encrypt the data that is to be sent to the other party by passing the encyrption/decryption key and the data to be sent into the symmertic encryption algorithm as depicted in Step 1. The algorithm will then output the encrypted data.

    * Thereafter, _Party A_, the sending party, will transmit the encrypted data output from Step 1 to the intended recipient, _Party B_. Provided that the encryption/decryption key is only know to Parties A and B, even if the encrypted data message is overheard by an eavesdropper, they will not be able to decrypt the message footnote:[Provided that the encryption/decryption key strength is sufficient.].

    * Finally, once _Party B_, the receiving party, receives the encrypted data, they can decrypt the data by passing the encryption/decryption key and the received decrypted data into the decryption algorithm which would output the unencrypted data.

Whilst, symmetric encryption is both rather trivial to comprehend and implement given that it makes use of a single encryption/decryption key that is shared amongst all participating parties, it also does not provide any guarantees with respect to: (i) being able to prove who sent a particular message --- i.e. any party can encrypt data and there's no way using this technique to know who encrypted and sent the data; and (ii) ensuring that communication intended for a particular party is only seen be that party.

The introduction of _asymmetric encryption_ in the 1970s provided a better solution to minimise potential eavesdroppers, ensuring that messages can only be decrypted by the party they were intended for as well as a way to authenticate the sender of a message. Asymmetric encryption makes use of two keys (required by each recipient): (i) a _public key_ belonging to the recipient which will be used by any party that wants to encrypt data intended for the specific recipient; and (ii) a _private key_ which the recipient keeps private to themselves and can be used to decrypt messages sent to them that others have encrypted using the recipeint's public key. The public and private keys are intimately linked together (which is why they are termed a key-pair) and it is impossible footnote:[or rather computationally infeasible] to determine the private key from the public key.


An overview of how typical communication takes place using assymetric key encryption is depicted in <<img_asym>>. The main differences in the process are depicted in red, and a description of the steps involved in the process follow:

=== Hash algorithms

Encryption techniques discussed above provide a secure end-to-end means of digital communication yet do not provide a solution to guaranteeing that data (unencrypted or not) has not changed over time. Hash algorithms provide a solution towards this. Given any arbitrary data as an input, a hash algorithm will output a unique fingerprint, called a hash, for the specific data. No matter how many times the same exact input is passed in, the same hash (fingerprint) will be output. If even a single bit of the input data changes, the outputted hash will change drastically. This is a required feature of a hash algorithm, i.e. that it is impossible footnote:[again, computationally infeasible] to find some other data input that would result in the same hash.

Once a hash is generated, potentially sent, and ultimately stored somewhere, anyone that has a copy of the hash can be guaranteed that the associated data used to generate the hash, has not been changed. This is because the
