== Governance on Cardano     


A full chapter has been written for 'Cardano for the masses' (up to date Jan 2024) which can serve as starting point for 'Mastering Cardano' governance chapter, but adjusted based on different guidelines and Voltaire updates in the coming months.

== Money is social\

With a few noteworthy exceptions most blockchains have made no provision
for future upgrades. The capacity to effectively drive a soft or hard
fork is critical to a cryptocurrency'92s long-term viability. As a
result, investors are unlikely to spend millions of dollars on protocols
whose roadmap and participants are fleeting, petty, or extremist. There
must be an efficient procedure for forming agreement on a vision for the
underlying protocol'92s evolution. Fragmentation might split the group
apart if this process is difficult. +
 +
Cryptocurrencies are an excellent illustration of money'92s social
component. When comparing Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin merely on the
basis of technology, there is little difference between the three.
Despite this, both Litecoin and Dogecoin have relatively large market
capitalizations, active communities, and their own social agendas. +
 +
It might be claimed that a significant portion of a cryptocurrency'92s
worth is generated from its community, how they use their funds, and how
involved they are in the currency'92s progress. Adding to the idea,
other currencies, such as Dash,footnote:[*Dash* is an open source
cryptocurrency and is a form of decentralized autonomous organization
(DAO) run by a subset of users, called '91masternodes'92. It is an
altcoin that was forked from the Bitcoin protocol. The currency permits
fast transactions that can be untraceable.\] Tezosfootnote:[*Tezos*
(ticker: XTZ) is a decentralized blockchain founded by Arthur Breitman
and Kathleen Breitman. The Breitmans also founded Dynamic Ledger
Solutions (DLS), a company primarily focused on developing Tezos
technology and owns the Tezos Intellectual property. The currency was
launched in an initial coin offering (ICO) on July 1, 2017.\] and
Polkdotfootnote:[Polkadot OpenGov, polkadot.network/features/opengov/\]
have built methods directly into the protocol to allow its users to vote
on what should be prioritized for development and funding. +
 +
The huge variety of cryptocurrencies also demonstrates their social
aspects. Fragmentation and forks result from disagreements over
philosophy, monetary policy, or even petty squabbling amongst the core
developers. CH at ScotFest 2022: +

____
People fall out over values, not facts +
 +
Unlike their digital cousins, fiat currencies tend to weather political
upheavals and local disputes without a currency crisis. It seems that
certain aspects of legacy systems are absent from the crypto sector.
Cardano'92s stance is that protocol users need incentives to understand
the social contract that underpins their system and the opportunity to
suggest modifications in a constructive manner. This independence
applies to every facet of a value exchange system, from market
regulation to project funding. However, it cannot be mediated by central
actors, nor does it need any credential that may be co-opted by a
privileged few. +
 +
Funding invariably dries up, regardless of the success of a
crowdsalefootnote:[*Crowdsales* are a popular use for Ethereum; they let
you allocate tokens to network participants in various ways, mostly in
exchange for Ether. They come in a variety of shapes and flavors.\] to
bootstrap development. As a result, Cardano contains a treasury that
reduces inflation and transaction fees over time. Through a ballot
mechanism, any user should be able to seek funds from the trust, and
stakeholders should vote on who becomes a beneficiary. By creating a
discussion about who should be financed, the process produces a positive
feedback loop like those found in other cryptocurrencies with governance
systems, such as Dash. Healthy dialogue ensures that the community is
always assessing and arguing its views ahead of crucial decisions. +
 +
Long running and, in many instances, unresolved disagreements about the
technical and moral direction of the codebase have plagued Bitcoin with
its block size debate, Ethereum with the DAO split, and a slew of other
cryptocurrencies. Many of these conflicts, as well as the splitting of
the community that occurs when action is taken, can be attributed to the
absence of any mechanism for implementing change. +
 +
Looking to lessons from the past, Bitcoin'92s adoption of (SegWit)
Segregated Witnessfootnote:[Segregated Witness, or SegWit, is the name
used for an implemented soft fork change in the transaction format of
bitcoin. \] could have been handled a lot better.footnote:[The Tale Of
SegWit: Controversy, Civil War & Adoption, blog.btse.com/segwit/ \] Did
the DAO attackfootnote:[Understanding the DAO attack,
coindesk.com/learn/2016/06/25/understanding-the-dao-attack/\] really
have to result in the hard fork on Ethereum? Could it have been managed
better so there was not such a dramatic community
breakdown?footnote:[Ethereum fall out,
fortune.com/2016/09/04/ethereum-fall-out/\] +
 +
In the worst-case scenario, moral authority to act might simply devolve
to whomever has the developers, infrastructure links, and money, rather
than the community'92s best interests. It'92s difficult to gauge if
actions are valid if a major segment of the community is unavailable, or
disengaged owing to poor incentives.footnote:[Incentive: a method of
encouraging members to participate in the network by providing them with
a return proportionate to their efforts. By promoting persistent,
active, and robust engagement, incentives strive to maintain equality
and fairness in a dispersed network of participants. The incentives
necessary in Cardano'92s incentives model are calculated using game
theory.\] +
 +
Some cryptocurrencies like Tezos have a model where the cryptocurrency
protocol is handled as a constitution, with three parts (Transaction,
Consensus, and Network) and a set of explicit rules and procedures for
updating the constitution. However, there is still a lot of work to be
done on incentives and how to represent and update a crypto protocol
using a formal language. +
 +
IOG have been researching governance in crypto for years. They have
written papers as far back as 2017 on proposing a treasury for Ethereum
Classic.footnote:[Kaidalov, Kovalchuk, Nastenko, Rodinko, Shevtzov,
Oliynykov (2017), '91A proposal for an Ethereum Classic Treasury
System'92,
iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/a-proposal-for-an-ethereum-classic-treasury-system/\]
Another paper, authored out of Lancaster University,footnote:[Zhang,
Oliynykov and Balogun (2019), '91A Treasury System for Cryptocurrencies:
Enabling Better Collaborative Intelligence'92,
eprint.iacr.org/2018/435.pdf \] focused on the concept of a treasury
system and a viable, democratic method to long-term development
financing for Cardano. +
 +
Formal methods, machine comprehensible specifications, and combining a
treasury with this process for financial incentives are just some of the
solutions IOG pursued. Looking back now, it'92s clear they were putting
the chess pieces in place, to create the apparatus necessary for the
_Age of Voltaire_ vision presented at ScotFestfootnote:[IO Scotfest: The
age of Voltaire,
youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnPTB0CuBOBxjkB8DdMhy57MriBCHT1RM\] in
November 2022. More on this later. +

== Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs)\

 +
One of the early governance pieces implemented in November 2020 was CIP
0001,footnote:[CIP-0001: Cardano Improvement Proposals,
github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0001\] which explains
what a CIP is. Anyone who has ideas for enhancing Cardano may present
them in the form of CIPs (Cardano improvement proposals). CIPs are a
means of formally proposing enhancements in a consensus-based manner.
They are an essential component of Cardano governance, even though they
are not binding, nor a requirement for treasury or protocol
modifications. +
 +
Technically, the first ever CIP was created in October 2019 and
subsequently became CIP-1852. It extends BIP44footnote:[BIP44 (Bitcoin
Improvement Proposal),
github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki\] and was written
to document how Cardano wallets handle keys and addresses. This document
existed even before the CIP process was created. It was named CIP-1852
by Sebastien Guillemot after the year Ada Lovelace died (her birth year,
1815, is used in the cointype field). +
 +
A CIP follows a standard format: the proposal structure is templated to
make debate and evaluation easier. This allows other members of the
community to weigh in on improvement recommendations, or issues in a
proposal. CIPs are kept as text files in a versioned GitHub
repo,footnote:[CIP repo, github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs\] and their
revision history provides the proposal's historical record. For those
who aren'92t on GitHub, cips.cardano.org is an auto-generated sister
site maintained by the Cardano Foundation. +
 +
There are three different typesfootnote:[Make it even better: Cardano's
Improvements Proposals,
cardanofoundation.org/en/news/make-it-even-better-cardanos-improvements-proposals\]
of CIP: +
\

[arabic]
. A *Standards Track CIP* is a modification that impacts Cardano
implementations. Examples: a network protocol update, or basically any
other change that affects the compatibility of Cardano applications.
CIPs on the Standards Track have two parts: a design doc and a reference
implementation. +
\
. A *Process CIP* outlines a Cardano-related process or suggests a
modification to one. Process CIPs are similar to Standards Track CIPs,
however they are used for topics other than the Cardano protocol. They
usually need community approval; thus, unlike Informational CIPs, they
are more than suggestions that users are not free to disregard. +
\
. An *Informational CIP* discusses a Cardano design issue or gives broad
Cardano community standards or information, but it does not propose
anything new. Users and implementers are entitled to disregard
Informational CIPs, or follow their advice because they do not
necessarily reflect a Cardano community consensus or suggestion. +
 +
Every CIP has the following format: Preamble, Abstract, Motivation,
Specification, Rationale, Path to Active, Copyright. The concept is
developed as a written proposal and submitted as a pull
requestfootnote:[Pull requests are a feature specific to GitHub. They
provide a simple, web-based way to submit your work (often called
'93patches'94) to a project. It's called a pull request because you're
asking the project to pull changes from your fork.\] to the CIP
repository after initial discussion and feedback. The updated Draft CIP
is then publicly processed in the following manner: +
 +
image:https://github.com/johnnygreeney/CardanoForTheMasses/blob/main/images/fig91.png[alt
text,title="figure 9.1"] +
**Figure 9.1:** CIP workflow from CIP0001 +
 +
CIPs are processed in a semi-formal manner: Editors of CIP proposals
meet on a regular basis to discuss and assess ideas. Meeting minutes are
available to the public,footnote:[CIP biweekly meetings,
github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/BiweeklyMeetings\] and
meetings are held every two weeks. Authors are encouraged to contribute
and offer comments, and discussions often take place simultaneously in
the Cardano forum CIPs sectionfootnote:[Cardano Forums CIP section,
forum.cardano.org/c/english/cips/12\] and/or in the GitHub pull
requests. If you have designs on becoming a CIP editor, you should read
Robert Phair'92s blog about his experience in the role.footnote:[Cardano
Improvement Proposals (CIPs) '97 Introduction from an Insider,
rxphair.medium.com/cardano-improvement-proposals-cips-introduction-from-an-insider-7b2f7cc94d01\] +
 +
Consider the CIP repository to be a collection of useful tools - some
may play well together, while others will not. You have complete control
over which CIPs your implementation adheres to. The community will lean
toward some more than others, new ones should be submitted as Cardano
grows. +
 +
*Notable CIPs:* +
 +
CIP 1 - CIP process +
'91A Cardano improvement proposal (CIP) is a formalized design document
for the Cardano community, providing information or describing a new
feature for the Cardano network, its processes, or environment in a
concise and technically efficient manner.'92 CIP 1 specifies three
statuses: Proposed, Active and Inactive and each CIP falls into a
category.footnote:[CIP-0001 categories,
github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0001#categories\] +
 +
CIP 9 - Protocol Parameters +
'91This CIP is an informational CIP that describes the initial protocol
parameter settings for the Shelley era of the Cardano blockchain, plus
the changes that have been made. It is intended to serve as a historic
record, allowing protocol parameter changes to be tracked back to the
original settings.'92 +
 +
CIP 25 - NFT Metadata Standard +
This proposal defines an NFT Metadata Standard for Native Tokens. +
 +
CIP 27 - CNFT Community Royalties Standard +
A community standard for royalties' functionality, that does not require
smart contracts to implement. +
 +
CIP 30 - Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge +
This CIP describes the communication bridge allowing dApps to interface
with Cardano wallets. +
 +
CIP 31 - Reference Inputs +
'91We introduce a new kind of input, a reference input, which allows
looking at an output without spending it. This will facilitate access to
information stored on the blockchain without the churn associated with
spending and recreating UTXOs.'92 +
 +
CIP 32 - Inline datums +
'91We propose to allow datums themselves to be attached to outputs
instead of datum hashes. This will allow much simpler communication of
datum values between users.'92 +
 +
CIP 33 - Reference scripts +
'91We propose to allow scripts ("reference scripts") to be attached to
outputs, and to allow reference scripts to be used to satisfy script
requirements during validation, rather than requiring the spending
transaction to do so. This will allow transactions using common scripts
to be much smaller.'92 +
 +
CIP 50 - Liesenfelt Shelleys Voltaire Decentralization Update +
Proposed by Dr Michael Liesenfelt, this CIP discusses the justification,
methods, metrics, and implementation schedule to increase Cardano'92s
decentralization. +
 +
CIP 68 - Datum Metadata Standard +
This proposal defines a metadata standard for native assets making use
of output datums not only for NFTs but any asset class. +
 +
CIP 79 - Implement Ouroboros Leois to increase Cardano throughput +
This CIP discusses the implementation of _Ouroboros Leios_. +
 +
CIP1694 - A First Step Towards On-Chain Decentralized Governance +
A proposal for Cardano's on-chain governance system to support the new
requirements for Voltaire. The busiest CIP to date, based on comments
and updates. See 1694.io which presents the CIP in a tidier format,
maintained by LIDO Nation. +
 +
CIP999 (read as '91CIP minus 1'92) - Cardano Problem Statements (CPS) +
CPSs complement CIPs. CIP999 explains the need for CPSs, their set
structure, statuses and criteria for their success. CPSs were introduced
to simplify the process when explaining the problem statement of complex
CIPs, replacing the more elaborate '91__motivation__'92 section. They
may also exist as standalone '91requests for proposals from ecosystem
actors who've identified a problem but are yet to find any suitable
solution'92. +

== What is Project Catalyst?\

 +
Another governance piece introduced in 2020 was Project Catalyst.
Catalyst is a grant program that combines proposal and voting processes.
Establishing a long-term future for Cardano growth began with a treasury
and democratic voting in the Catalyst project. +
 +
Catalyst is a community-driven innovation grants program that uses
elements of decentralized governance to make certain decisions (i.e. the
Cardano community votes to decide which proposals should receive grant
funding). Funds are granted as ada, provided to IOG directly from the
Cardano treasury, to administer the funding disbursements. +
 +
There are effectively two parts to Catalyst: +
\

[arabic]
. Submitting, reviewing, and voting on proposals\
. Delivering the grant-funded project and demonstrating proof of
achievement as part of the community-led accountability model +
 +
So in this way, members of the Cardano community submit proposals to
deliver projects for the benefit of growing the Cardano ecosystem. The
community then reviews the project proposals, providing feedback based
on criteria of '91Impact'92, '91Feasibility'92, and '91Value for Money'.
Finally the community then votes on which proposals to allocate funding
towards. Catalyst currently uses IdeaScalefootnote:[Cardano IdeaScale,
cardano.ideascale.com/\] to crowdsource all proposal submissions and
community reviews. ProjectCatalyst.io is a home for all things Catalyst
and is where all of the funded-projects progress reporting and
accountability is ultimately open and available for community members to
keep track of their favorite projects they voted for. +
 +

text,title="figure 9.3"] +
**Figure 9.3:** The opening screen for each Catalyst Town Hall meeting +
 +
*Cardano'92s Treasury* +
 +
To solve the issues, a variety of treasury systems have emerged. These
systems might include iterative treasury rounds when project funding
requests are presented, debated, and voted on. Poor voter privacy and
ballot submission security are two typical downsides. Furthermore, if
master nodes are coerced, the validity of funding choices may be
jeopardized, and a lack of expert input may promote undesired
contributions. +
 +
Cardano was established as a third-generation blockchain to address the
shortcomings of previous projects. Cardano aims to make the process more
democratic by giving everyone influence and guaranteeing that choices
are made fairly. It is critical to have transparent voting and financing
mechanisms to achieve this. This is where Voltaire enters the picture. +
 +
The aforementioned (Lancaster University) paper on treasury systems for
cryptocurrencies proposes a community-controlled, decentralized,
collaborative decision-making method for long-term blockchain
development and maintenance financing. This kind of collaborative
intelligence is based on liquid democracy,footnote:[Liquid democracy is
a form of delegative democracy where an electorate engages in collective
decision-making through direct participation and dynamic representation.
This democratic system leverages parts of both direct and representative
democracy.\] which is a combination of direct, and representative,
democracy that combines the advantages of both. +
 +
This method allows the Treasury System to use expert knowledge in the
voting process while also guaranteeing that all ada holders are given a
chance to vote. As a result, for each project, a voter may vote
personally or delegate their voting authority to a community member who
is knowledgeable about the subject. +
 +
To maintain long-term viability, the community controls the treasury
system, which is regularly replenished from sources such as: +
\

* a share of stake pool rewards and transaction costs \
* contributions or charities \
* newly minted coins held back for future financing. +
 +
The treasury will then be able to finance initiatives and pay for
improvement suggestions since ada is always accumulating. As a result,
the financing process may be split into '91treasury periods,'92 each of
which is divided into the following phases: +
\
* pre-voting \
* voting\
* post-voting. +
 +
Project ideas may be presented at any time throughout the term, debated
by experts and voters, and then voted on to finance the most critical
initiatives. Despite the fact that anybody may submit a proposal, only a
select few will be funded, based on a community vote. +
 +
*Decision making process* +
 +
Scientists (even nuclear physicists),footnote:[Cardano Network
Parameters with Dr. Michael Liesenfelt | Cardano Live #54,
youtube.com/watch?v=eAs_L68RO-c\] developers, executive types,
investors, and the general public are among the ada holders who vote.
With such a diverse field of participants, with different agendas and
motives, there must be proper mechanisms in place to preserve
inclusivity, and ensure fair reviews and voting takes place. +
 +
A person'92s voting power is proportional to the quantity of ada they
hold; the more ada they own, the more weight their vote carries. Along
with direct '91yes'92 voting, a person might transfer their voting
authority to an expert they trust as part of the liquid democracy
concept. Note that '91No'92 voting was removed in Fund11. In this
instance, the expert votes on behalf of their delegators. +
 +
Following the vote, project ideas may be assessed and ranked depending
on the number of yes/no votes; the poorest project proposals will be
eliminated. The top-ranked ideas will be financed in turn until the
allocated treasury money is depleted, after which the shortlisted
proposals will be ranked according to their score. Breaking down the
decision-making process into phases ensures each proposal is rigorously
and fairly critiqued. +
 +
IOG'92s research team leveraged ZK proofs to safeguard voter privacy.
Zero-knowledge (ZK) approaches are mathematical methods for verifying
information without exposing any underlying facts. The zero-knowledge
proof in this situation indicates that someone may vote without
providing any personal information other than their eligibility to vote.
Any prospect of voter coercion is eliminated as a result. +
 +
Project Catalyst is a treasury system that combines proposals, and
voting processes, with the goal of fostering a democratic culture in the
Cardano community. Cardano'92s treasury will initially be replenished by
a proportion of stake pool payouts, assuring a long-term treasury
supply. Other blockchains have treasury systems, but IOG'92s combines
perfect anonymity thanks to zero-knowledge proofs, liquid democracy
thanks to expert engagement and vote delegation (planned for Catalyst in
2024), and community participation. +
 +
It'92s also worth noting that this treasury system technique may be used
on blockchains other than Cardano. It has previously been suggested that
it be implemented for Ethereum Classicfootnote:[The ETC Cooperative
Withdraws Support For The ETC Treasury,
medium.com/etccooperative/the-etc-cooperative-withdraws-support-for-the-etc-treasury-c3f8772fff71\]
and we'92ll see later how COTI availed of the Catalyst Natives
feature. +
 +
Following a successful limited user group trial, Project Catalyst became
accessible to the public. Although Cardano on-chain governance is still
in its infancy, all metrics and indicators point to a bright future with
the community leading the way. +

There are a lot of moving parts to Catalyst. This graphic from IOG'92s

is a good summary of the steps involved and end goals. +
\

[[catalyst92s-early-funds-]]
== Catalyst'92s early funds \

 +
In Sept 2020, IOG announced the establishment of Project Catalyst'92s
first public fund, a milestone for Cardano in terms of on-chain
governance, treasury, and community innovation. +
 +
The public fund was launched after five months of intensive activity
across two earlier pilot funds. The first experiment, dubbed '91Fund
0,'92 was conducted with the help of an IOG focus group. Fund1 was the
first time the concept was shared with the Cardano community, enlisting
the aid of over 50 people to help IOG construct the platform and
procedures. While this voting round did not provide '91real'92
financing, it was a significant opportunity for the IOG team and the
Cardano community to test and enhance the new process. +
 +
There was a long way to go. However, with the help of the community, IOG
sustained a steady rate of advancement. If Fund0 was the technical run
through, then Fund1 was the dress rehearsal. Fund2, which was announced
in September 2020,footnote:[Dr Dor Garbash, '91Project Catalyst;
introducing our first public fund for Cardano community innovation'92,
iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/09/16/project-catalyst-introducing-our-first-public-fund-for-cardano-community-innovation/\]
was the opening night when the community'92s top performers fought for
financing to bring their concept to fruition. +
 +
*Funding great proposals* +
 +
IOG'92s pioneer group of 50 community members assisted them in
identifying areas for improvement so that they could build and enhance
the process before making it more broadly available. Clarifying the
documentation and standards encouraged community members to participate
more and submit proposals. +
 +
To that end, IOG worked on a guide to assist anybody in creating their
best proposal possible for Fund2 and beyond. The community could access
up to $250k worth of ada in the first public fund. +
 +
IOG started small, asking the community to respond to a challenge
statement: '91How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to
create dApps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next six months?'92
Funding proposals could address this with a broad range of concepts,
including marketing campaigns and infrastructure development, as well as
business planning and content production. +
 +
The first step was to '91examine the problem,'92 which included asking
members of the community for their input. Then, through a special
Telegram chat channel,footnote:[Catalyst Telegram Channel,
t.me/cardanocatalyst\] IOG urged everyone to submit their ideas to the
innovation platform, where they could collaborate and debate. +
 +
*The public votes* +
 +
IOG put things to a vote after the phases of brainstorming, cooperation,
and proposal. Proposals were evaluated on IdeaScale, or via a mobile
voting application. When it came time to vote, everyone registered using
the voting app. Each participant'92s '91right'92 to vote is connected to
their ada holdings, and voting will earn them further ada rewards.
Voting works similarly to a '91transaction,'92 enabling all participants
to cast a vote to say '91yes'92 or '91no.'92 +
 +
*How it works* +
 +
Voltaire is a critical component of the Cardano ecosystem since it
enables every ada holder to participate in decision making about the
platform'92s future development and contribute to the ecosystem'92s
growth. Project Catalyst is a critical first step in achieving such
capacity. +
 +
image:https://github.com/johnnygreeney/CardanoForTheMasses/blob/main/images/fig95.png[alt
text,title="figure 9.5"] +
**Figure 9.5:** Catalyst '91here'92s how it works'92 +
 +
Fund3 went live in January 2021, and with each fund, IOG wanted to grow
the Catalyst community by encouraging more individuals to participate.
Every funding round starts with a set of objectives. Each challenge
symbolizes the Cardano community'92s '91intention,'92 a common objective
to accomplish. IOG likes to speak about '91return on intention'92 as a
means of monitoring project success. Each challenge is intended to be
wide enough to elicit both technical and general ideas while remaining
focused. +
 +
Fund2 had a $250,000 ada pool, while Fund3 doubled that, awarding
$500,000 in ada to proposers, voters, and community advisors. The
breadth, amount of money, and community participation have all increased
with each funding cycle. On the IdeaScale innovation platform in Feb
2021, there were 7,000 members and 1,800 active voters. Adoption was
increasing by 10% per week. +
 +
Fund4 was the most accessible and ambitious round yet, as well as the
first million-dollar round '97 the ada pot used to finance Cardano
development initiatives. The funding was used by proposal teams to
create tools, construct dApps, establish developer education and
training efforts, and much more. +
 +
IOG continued to make the project more available to the Cardano
community during 2021 to promote participation. Voter registration
increased considerably. The redesigned registration center was now
completely connected with the Daedalus wallet. Yoroi lite wallet users
could easily register via a browser plugin. After that, voters could
finish the process using a specific mobile voting app, which can be
downloaded on iOS or Android. Project Catalyst had risen to become the
world'92s biggest decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in less
than six months. +
\

== Catalyst Circle\

 +
As Fund4 came to an end in July 2021, Catalyst had already proven itself
as a one-stop hub for teamwork and decentralized innovation. However,
this rapid expansion brought with it new obstacles. +
 +
Project Catalyst was gaining in contributions from increasingly
different functional groups who were helping to bring the collective
intelligence forward. Specifically, community advisors,
funded-proposers, stake pool operators (SPOs), toolmakers & maintainers,
all who contribute to Catalyst'92s success and expansion. +
 +
Project Catalyst gains from having a broader set of participants as it
results in more diverse ideas and proposals. It also makes communication
between all of these groups more difficult. Every cohort wants to be
heard, and their thoughts and concerns need to be aired at the project
level. +
 +
These groups need representation and trustworthy leadership to advocate
for them. Project Catalyst'92s influence would be severely reduced if
such representation was inadequate or non-existent. This is why the
Catalyst Circle was created. Catalyst Circlefootnote:[Introducing the
Catalyst Circle,
iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/08/introducing-the-catalyst-circle\] was a
'91human sensor array'92 that served as a representative body for all
the Project Catalyst participants. The Circle kept track of Catalyst'92s
present state and future intentions for governance. Within the Catalyst
ecosystem, it identified and discussed issues, objections, and
possibilities. For example, the Circle might debate the amounts
distributed to a fund, tweaks or conditions to incentive parameters, the
Catalyst API, and so on. +
 +
This activity gave an insight into the hopes, desires, needs, and
worries of the community inside Project Catalyst by documenting meetings
and collecting activities in a backlog available to
everyone.footnote:[Catalyst Circle meeting minutes,
catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle/minutes\] The Circle was also
in charge of choosing its own future form and designing the Circle
election procedures. Catalyst Circle was paused after V4. It will likely
restart, or resurface in a new form, with the learnings and experiences
key to any future incarnations. +

== Catalyst Natives \

 +
As part of Project Catalyst, the first Catalyst Natives pilot was
launched in late 2021. Catalyst Natives allows any project to tap into
the collective intelligence of the community to solve business
challenges and outsource projects. Catalyst Natives gives decentralized
innovation fund management to partners, some external to Cardano, aiming
to develop their ecosystem by incentivizing innovators to assist in
finding solutions to problems. +
 +
*COTI, the first Catalyst Native* +
 +
Catalyst Natives expands access to Project Catalyst to organizations
outside of the Cardano ecosystem could now present challenges and give
incentives and rewards to individuals who successfully satisfy the
challenge with their suggested innovations. +
 +
COTI presented the communityfootnote:[Introducing Catalyst Natives - How
any business can leverage the Cardano innovation engine,
iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/10/introducing-catalyst-natives-how-any-business-can-leverage-the-cardano-innovation-engine/\]
with a novel technological challenge in this pilot, which was to create
an innovative plug-in to be integrated with their existing ADA Pay
systemfootnote:[ADA Pay, adapay.finance/\] to support all the different
e-commerce software solutions. +
 +
Following the pilot, IOG allowed Catalyst Natives to accept more
challenges from other entities; however, these challenges were selected
by IOG, in the first phase, to ensure they provide value to the Cardano
ecosystem. Organizations proposing challenges via Natives will finance
those ideas, thus Catalyst Natives will not utilize Cardano Treasury
funds to pay for the initiatives that have been successfully voted on.
COTI distributed $100k in COTI tokens in Fund7, which was in addition to
the $8m ada fund. +
 +
Catalyst Natives is an opportunity for businesses of all sizes to have
access to a vault of ideas and the people who can help them come to
life. Catalyst Natives is now aiming to assist Cardano ecosystem
partners, and native asset token projects, handle particular pain points
for which they either do not have the resources, or simply do not have a
solution, and outsource them as Catalyst challenges for proposers to
solve. +
\

== Later Funds\

 +
Every Catalyst fund cycle has provided new, remarkable accomplishments.
Fund7 was no different. +

**Figure 9.6:** Fund7 stats +
 +
After the votes were tabulated and counted in Fund7, 269 additional
initiativesfootnote:[Fund 7 initiatives,
drive.google.com/file/d/193GZulHuk0zhpTrMiLhcNC4OeEMoRyIa/view\] were
selected to get ada. Given that each of these projects was created in
response to 24 real-world problems provided by the Cardano community, as
well as one additional task issued by COTI, Cardano'92s first Catalyst
Native pioneer, these were impressive numbers. +
 +
This time around, over 52,500 wallets registered to vote, and community
advisers reviewed over 900 proposals to assist voters make informed
judgements. The number of ideas financed by the Cardano Treasury had
almost quadrupled in a short period of time, reaching 575 projects. +
 +
The Cardano Treasury now contained roughly 800m ada in order to maintain
and build the ecosystem. Many of the projects that were funded in
previous rounds have now been completed and their end products were
being showcased.footnote:[Project Catalyst - Funded Projects Reporting
(public MVP),
docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bfnWFa94Y7Zj0G7dtpo9W1nAYGovJbswipxiHT4UE3g/edit#gid=416498551\] +
 +
*Fund8* +
 +
Every three months, a new Project Catalyst innovation fund campaign
launches, offering the chance to obtain resources from the Cardano
Treasury. Fund8 offered $16m funding in ada. +
 +
Fund8 resultsfootnote:[Fund 8 results,
drive.google.com/file/d/1s3jCE7pmoUujy3ASMia-UhFl2KLi_hnf/view\]
confirmed the momentum just keeps growing as voting turnout increased
and a diverse range of projects were funded. One of the smallest amounts
requested, and funded, was also one of the most significant. Sebastien
Guillemot'92s successful proposalfootnote:[CIP Editor funded,
twitter.com/SebastienGllmt/status/1525139808926191618\] meant he was the
first CIP editor to be paid for his time. More editors followed, serving
as stewards of the CIP process. +
 +
Catalyst also partnered with the Financial Times and Seedstars
(seedstars.com) to launch the _FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge_ where
selected startups participated in a 3-day Bootcamp and connected to
Seedstars'92 network of mentors. 24 startups were selected to
participate in a 3-month Acceleration Program.'92 More details are on
Seedstar'92s website.footnote:['91FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge'92,

____
This is why it'92s so incredibly important that you have a treasury
system '85and voting systems because right now here'92s how the
cryptocurrency space works and this is why things get so toxic '85.you
have a very small group of people who are developers, investors, big
people who are actually building stuff in the space, the entrepreneurial
class, developer class the infrastructure class'85 then you have the
speculators which are everybody else '85and they hold the currency,
they'92re fans of it, maybe even philosophically aligned with it '85but
they don'92t have a voice, they can'92t do anything '85they'92re just
sitting there just hoping for things to materialize. +
 +
'85and then a subset of them maybe move into the other class when they
have smart contracts or whatever'85 but the vast majority of them are
there yet they have opinions about where things should go'85what they
should do '85and so the key is to give them tools to organize'85 tools
to vote'85 tools to discuss the philosophy and direction '85to have
teeth, not just '91here'92s my opinion'92, but also when my opinion is
let manifest and gets a democratic consent behind it '85then that
opinion will turn into money '85that then can be used by the other
class. +
 +
All of a sudden everybody has power and actually has a voice ..and an
opinion and you'92re not just talking about when is this coming out, or
what is is it that is coming out'85you'92re actually talking about where
do we want to go, and how are we going to get there and the things we
need to do to get there'85 who'92s the best leader to get there'85 you
can'92t fork that'85. you can fork the code and have another Treasury
system'85but it'92s like saying well that big meetup group over there'85
I'92m going to host my own meetup group and I'92m going to copy
everything'85 the same banners and the same catering and the same
everything'85 it doesn'92t mean other people are going to show up +

== The Cardano cFund\

 +
The cFund, which was first unveiled at the 2020 Shelley summit, is an
early-stage investment fund that focuses on creative firms on Cardano.
Wave Financial, in collaboration with IOG, manages the cFund, a
crypto-native hedge fund. The fund uses an early-stage venture approach
to invest in creative technological firms that are building
Cardano-based apps, services, and products, as well as other R&D
projects that IOG is working on. +
 +
*The '91c'92 in cFund* +
 +
The letter '91c'92 in the name relates to the mathematics word
'91coefficient,'92 which refers to a variable'92s multiplier. cFund is
positioned to provide a multiplier effect in terms of growth and reach
for its portfolio firms by using both IOG'92s and Wave Financial'92s
subject knowledge and industry relationships. +
 +
*Services offered* +
 +
The cFund serves as a funding provider, adviser, and partner to its
portfolio firms and the greater Cardano ecosystem. cFund delivers access
and direction to its portfolio by using IOG and Wave Financial
resources, reputation, knowledge, and network. cFund is a great believer
in adding value to its investments and strives to be the first port of
call for management teams. +
 +
According to IOG'92s foundational philosophy of '91cascading
disruption,footnote:[Cardano | The First Domino,
youtube.com/watch?v=W7gGO058rtU\] most of the structures that make up
global financial, governance, and social systems are inherently
unstable, and slight disturbances may generate a ripple effect that
radically reconfigures the system. The purpose of cFund is to find and
fund solutions that bring these disparities together in a fair and
transparent way for all participants. While other
cryptocurrenciesfootnote:[Crypto Startup Solana Raises $314 Million to
Develop Faster Blockchain,
wsj.com/articles/crypto-startup-solana-raises-314-million-to-develop-faster-blockchain-11623240001\]
have strong ties to Silicon Valley, Cardano is innovating with Catalyst
acting as its own '91built in'92 funding mechanism. +
 +
COTI, a decentralized and scalable payments network for the e-commerce
sector, was cFund'92s first investment in this area. +
 +
Another example is Occam.Fi, a suite of DeFi solutions optimized for
Cardano. Their initial product is a decentralized financing platform.
The next generation of DeFi apps will be able to raise funding utilizing
the Cardano blockchain thanks to this launchpad. +
 +
*October 16, 2020. '85There are a lot of different funds so could you
explain to us what is DC fund, cFund and the Cardano Foundation fund?*
CH:footnote:[Entrevista CEO IOG Charles Hoskinson e Maria Carmo #Cardano
#ada Delegue na CARDs ou @cardanistas, youtu.be/rHu6oLTZ7kI?t=3061\] +
\

____
So, the DC fund is what we'92ve termed the funds that are coming out of
Catalyst'85 and those are grant models '85 Cardano doesn'92t have
agency, so we can'92t own land, it can'92t have intellectual property'85
it can'92t have equity, these types of things '85so when it gives out
funding'85 It's like when the National science foundation (NSF) gives
out funding, or DARPAfootnote:[DARPA: The Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency is a research and development agency of the United
States Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging
technologies for use by the military\] gives out funding '85where it'92s
funding the development of something because we, as a society, have
determined that that is a good idea. +
 +
So, for example when NSF gives research for theoretical physics '85it
says we, as a society, would like our brilliant physicist to be well
funded so that they can figure out how time works and gravity works and
so forth '85but there'92s no money that comes out of that '85or these
things but there'92s a social benefit, that potentially could be
leveraged over time to make the country better'85 Perhaps we invent
anti-gravity at some point '85. but it'92s not the primary goal. +
 +
So, we look at DC fund like that '85. where we say it'92s a '91return on
intention'92. Grants are coming through, and the goal is to make Cardano
better'85. but it'92s not to make Bob a millionaire, or something like
that'85 +
 +
cFund is a venture capital arm of my company and Wavesfootnote:[Waves,
everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/waves-cryptocurrency\]'85 we'92re working
together and setting all of that up and basically that'92s going to be
where you run a project and you come to Charles and the others who are
involved with that'85 you say, '91I would like you to invest in my
company'85 and give me the resources I need to get it to the next
level'85. and then we would look at you like any venture capitalist
would look at you'85. ask you the same questions Andreessen Horowitz
(a16z.com) will ask you, or Kleiner Perkins (kleinerperkins.com) will
ask you and so forth '85and if we determine it'92s a good investment,
I'92ll open up the checkbook and cut a check and send your way and we
get equity back for that, because that'92s a private investment. +
 +
Then the Cardano Foundation they have something called the CCCI,
Commercially Critical Cardano Infrastructure'85 and that'92s saying
there needs to be some product validation and bootstrapping, that
Cardano really is competitive, or capable of doing the things that
Ethereum and EOS and Tezos and Algorand do. +
 +
So we'92re going to give out some very specific very targeted grants to
help get the ecosystem along '85okay the DC Fund, the community is in
charge of that '85 the grants from the (Cardano) Foundation, the
Foundation'92s in charge of that and they'92re very directed towards
catching us up and getting us where we need to go to compete with
Ethereum and the rest of the gang '85and the cFund is a good
old-fashioned investment for things that I think we ought to have on our
ecosystem. +
\
____

== dReps\

 +
IOG introduced the notion of delegating your voting rights to a Delegate
Representatives (dReps), and urged people interested to register during
a Fund8 Project Catalyst Town Hall.footnote:[Project Catalyst Fund8
launch - Town Hall #1 February 2022, youtube.com/watch?v=rNZJvzjgduM\] +
 +
The ongoing growth of the Cardano ecosystem is great news but, on the
other hand, offers a problem. The community'92s obligation to examine
and vote on ideas grows as the quantity of proposals grows. A new
approach was needed to guarantee that all ideas get the attention they
deserve, as well as to support further development. +
 +
Ada holders may give their votes to one or more dReps through
delegation. This provides the more passive voter with a chance to have
their voice heard, but now across a larger number of proposals than they
could read and evaluate personally. +
 +
Catalyst dReps will vote on most Project Catalyst proposals, improving
the quality of decision-making within each Fund. dReps will collaborate
to develop policy, gather and evaluate data, consult with experts, and
ultimately vote on a variety of initiatives and issues proposed by the
community. If you'92d like to get involved, you can join the dRep
pioneers here.footnote:[Catalyst dRep applications, bit.ly/3rSyHvP\] +
 +
*Fund9* +
 +
Catalyst'92s relentless, Borg-like momentum continued with Fund9 opening
in June 2022. There is typically something new and innovative with the
arrival of each fund, and this time Cardashiftfootnote:[Cardashift is a
community-run launchpad that raises funds, builds and accelerates
startups that are solving social and environmental issues.\] joined the
Catalyst Natives program.footnote:[Fernando Sanchez, '91Introducing
Catalyst Natives - How any business can leverage the Cardano innovation
engine'92,
iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/10/introducing-catalyst-natives-how-any-business-can-leverage-the-cardano-innovation-engine\]
Their challengefootnote:[Fund9 Catalyst Natives Cardashift challenge:
demonstrating and monetizing impact,
iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/06/01/fund9-catalyst-natives-cardashift-challenge-demonstrating-and-monetizing-impact/\]
was based on value creation through positive impact-oriented projects.
Cardashift listed Cardano'92s '91green'92 credentials, its focus on
Africa and its deterministic nature among their reasons for partnering
with Catalyst in their medium blog post.footnote:[The 3 reasons why we
choose Cardano to maximize our impact,
cardashift.medium.com/the-3-reasons-why-we-choose-cardano-to-maximize-our-impact-28b2e914e894\]
As with every quarterly fund, the rewards for successful proposals
increased. The Fund9 launch guidefootnote:[Fund9 launch guide,
drive.google.com/file/d/1kJ8F6doXUIJQRiA5pmSMxXc9feVfF21y/view\]
outlined how the 16m ada was to be allocated. +
\

== Tactical Pause for Catalyst\

 +
Although Catalyst has been a huge success in many ways, it'92s not
perfect. There were also questionsfootnote:[@cwpaulm questions
CardaxDEX,
twitter.com/cwpaulm/status/1597666144059432960?s=20&t=HBr5f_ZkSoMQ4rzv0eIdOA\]
asked of Fund6 winner Cardax DEX after launching on Milkomeda
(dcSpark'92s Cardano sidechain) instead of Cardano mainchain as
initially proposed. There were rumblings of discontent when one the 205
winners of Fund9 was a controversial proposal called _Daedalus Turbo_.
The problem statement of the proposal read: +
\

____
Daedalus, the decentralized Cardano wallet, is painfully slow, taking a
whole day to sync initially and hours to resync when used only
occasionally'97an unfavorable impression of Cardano for new users. +
 +
image:https://github.com/johnnygreeney/CardanoForTheMasses/blob/main/images/rick.png[alt
text,title="Rick tweet"] +
 +
Many Cardano users felt aggrieved as the sum rewarded was large, with
other projects missing out. Anyone conducting a basic '91gap
analysis,'92 as SPO Rick McCracken tweeted,footnote:[Daedalus Turbo gap
analysis,
twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1575057817181966337?s=20&t=XXfR1C0qB9jx6InYxgpQEA\]
would probably arrive at the same conclusion that the project was not
timely as years of research and product development were already devoted
to Mithril. For anyone following Cardano, IOG'92s _Lace_ (lace.io) light
wallet has been prioritized over Daedalus for some time. +
 +
From a user experience perspective, many people felt overwhelmed trying
to track over a thousand proposals for a given fund on IdeaScale. Many
promising projects have gone unfunded. It was generally welcomed by the
community when IOG announced a '91time out'92 for Catalyst in a November
2022 blog post.footnote:[Repositioning Project Catalyst ahead of the
next funding round,
iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/11/01/repositioning-project-catalyst-ahead-of-the-next-funding-round/\] +
 +
As Catalyst took a break, there was a timely SoKfootnote:[Systemization
of Knowledge (SoK) papers evaluate, systematize, and contextualize
existing knowledge.\] research paperfootnote:[Kiayias, Lazos (2022),
'SoK: Blockchain Governance', arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07188.pdf\] published
just around this same time, reflecting on the state of governance in ten
blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano. +
 +
The paper lists *seven properties* by which to assess different
requirements for effective blockchain governance. +
\
____

[arabic]
. *Suffrage* deals with participation eligibility, how inclusive is the
governance mechanism? \
. *Confidentiality*: are decision-makers'92 inputs protected from
'91external influences'92? \
. *Verifiability*: can decision-makers confirm their input has been
considered in the output?\
. *Accountability* relates to decision-makers being held accountable for
their input\
. *Sustainability* questions if decision-makers are suitably
incentivised?\
. *Pareto efficiency* asks '91how well the intentions of the
decision-makers can be turned into actions?'92\
. *Liveness* is a measure of how quickly a blockchain'92s governance
mechanism can produce outputs efficiently +
 +

text,title="figure 9.7"] +
**Figure 9.7:** The partition map of governance properties from the
'91SoK: Blockchain Governance'92 paper +
 +
The paper concludes that while each blockchain displays some of the
properties, no blockchain meets all the requirements for effective
governance. It was food for thought just before the dawn of the _Age of
Voltaire_. +
 +
With the Catalyst pause after Fund9 and the _Age of Voltaire_ still in
its infancy, the Catalyst team introduced a new concept in the first
Town Hall of 2023 called _Special Voting Events (SVE)_ that leveraged
Catalyst tooling. A SVE was a vote held that was unrelated to Catalyst
fund cycles. It was a stopgap measure for obtaining community consent on
important decisions before Catalyst resumed with Fund10 and new
governance tools were being built to allow for polls and temperature
checks. We learned in ScotFest 2022 presentations that Catalyst is
merely a sighter for the Age of Voltaire, and 2023 would be about
integrating tooling to ultimately facilitate the implementation of CIP
1694footnote:[CIP 1694,
github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP 1694\] which we will
discuss shortly. +
 +
*Fund10* +
 +
Catalyst made a welcome return with Fund10 in June 2023. The updates and
changes were announced in a blog post.footnote:[Co-building the gears of
innovation through the relaunch of Project Catalyst with Fund10,
projectcatalyst.io/blog/co-building-the-gears-of-innovation-through-the-relaunch-of-project-catalyst-with-fund10\]
Catalyst'92s Lead Architect, Stephen Johnson, walked through the details
and demoedfootnote:[Project Catalyst - Weekly Town Hall - #128,
youtu.be/CaKQAhnOKbE?t=1819\] how the community could now start to
interact with the '91Catalyst continuous testnet'92. +
 +
Up until Fund10, Catalyst was implemented as a mix of on-chain and
off-chain components. Proposals lived on IdeaScale, supported by android
and iphone voting apps and a dependence on the re-purposed
Jormungandrfootnote:[Jormungandr Node,
github.com/input-output-hk/jormungandr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\] node
(previously used for the Incentivized Testnet). As the Voltaire era
unfolds, the voting experience has moved into the growing list of light
wallets, complemented by a new website, projectcatalyst.io. +
 +
Fund10 saw 192 projects, from 100 unique proposers, receive a total of
50 million ADA in funding from the Cardano community. After the pause,
deep in a bear market, ada holders were clearly hungry for Catalyst'92s
resumption with approximately 409,000 votes cast, a 12.48% increase
compared to Fund9. +
 +
The most significant moment of Fund10 was that it was the first time the
community could decide who should be in charge of Catalyst. The
community voted for IOG to continue to provide services to the community
as the Catalyst Fund Operator.footnote:[Project Catalyst Fund10
proposals: forging the road ahead, together,
projectcatalyst.io/blog/project-catalyst-fund10-proposals-forging-the-road-ahead-together\] +
 +
The Catalyst team'92s proposalfootnote:[IOG Catalyst Team : Ideascale
replacement and web-browser based Voting Centre with liquid democracy
aka '93Catalyst Voices'94,
.lidonation.com/en/proposals/iog-catalyst-team-ideascale-replacement-and-web-browser-based-voting-centre-with-liquid-democracy-aka-catalyst-voices-f10\]
is to replace IdeaScale with '91Catalyst Voices'92. Michael Madoff, the
Group Product Manager for Voltaire, joined Kriss Baird (Group Product
Manager) for Town Hall #140footnote:[Project Catalyst - Weekly Town Hall
- #140, youtube.com/watch?v=2f7v0x6xal0&t=2548s\] to explain how
Catalyst fits in the overall Voltaire roadmap era. Madoff explained: +
\

____
We learned a lot about experiments with Community governance through
everything that's happened in Catalyst and the contributions everyone
here has made +
 +
There was pushback from some proposers, for example on Twitter
(X),footnote:[Cardanopace on X,
twitter.com/cardanopace/status/1694373619961393534?s=20\] PACE posted: +
 +
This is a massive concern as IOG has a direct incentive to remove
competition from categories they are competing in. +
 +
There was also an articlefootnote:[Cardano Project Catalyst: Dissecting
the Imbalance in Voting Power,
thecryptobasic.com/2023/09/05/cardano-project-catalyst-dissecting-the-imbalance-in-voting-power/\]
highlighting that a very small fraction of the community has
disproportionately large voting power and that up to 50% of wallet
holders have virtually no influence, controlling only 1% of the voting
power. +
 +
Some suggested Quadratic Votingfootnote:[Quadratic voting is a
collective decision-making procedure which involves individuals
allocating votes to express the degree of their preferences, rather than
just the direction of their preferences.\] could address this issue,
while others rejected the suggestion. Adam Rusch posted his views that
_Quadratic Voting is not a silver bullet for Governance_ on Cardano
Forum.footnote:[Quadratic Voting is not a silver bullet for Governance,
forum.cardano.org/t/quadratic-voting-is-not-a-silver-bullet-for-governance/116135\] +
 +
Each project team was now obliged to provide more transparency by
formulating their 'Statement of Milestones,' using the Milestone
Module,footnote:[Project Catalyst Milestone Module,
milestones.projectcatalyst.io/\] which monitors critical checkpoints
throughout the project'92s lifecycle. Projectcatalyst.io also had a full
data refresh updating with all the Fund10 cohort data. This enabled
users to track the progress of each funded project within the milestone
program. LIDO NATION had previously bloggedfootnote:['91From Prototype
to Powerhouse: Catalyst Explorer in Fund 10 and beyond'92,
lidonation.com/en/posts/from-prototype-to-powerhouse-catalyst-explorer-in-fund-10-and-beyond\]
that '93the hardest part of providing the Catalyst Explorer has been
getting the data.'94 +
 +
The power and reach of Catalyst hit home for me personally, when a
proposalfootnote:['91Cardano For the M\uc0\u8371 sses - Japanese
Book'92,
lidonation.com/en/proposals/cardano-for-the-marasses-japanese-book-f10\]
to translate this book into Japanese was approved in Fund10. Another
notable funded proposalfootnote:[Johnny Nguyen and Dor Garbash Fund10

lidonation.com/de/proposals/for-the-community-by-the-community-optimizing-the-roi-of-catalyst-through-listening-to-builders-expert-analysis-and-assessment-of-cardanos-community-g-f10\]
was submitted by former IOG employees, Johnny Nguyen and Dor Garbash.
Their project is _'91For the community, by the community: Optimizing the
ROI of Catalyst through listening to builders, expert analysis and
assessment of Cardano'92s Community Grants Fund. Brought to you by
Catalyst and Intersect MBO Architects.'92_ +
 +
*Fund11* +
 +
Updates to Fund11 were announced at the Dubai Cardano Summit in November
2023. Many of the changes addressed feedback from the community. The
'91downvote'92 made a welcome exit, a cap of five proposals per person
was introduced and proposers could not have anything projects open from
Fund7 or earlier. Fund11 also saw the birth of '91Working Groups'92.
It'92s not clear how they will function just yet, but will likely be
something similar to what _Catalyst Circle_ was. Fund11 saw the
following three categories: +
\
____

* Concept: for brand new ideas limited to a budget of 100K ada.\
* Solution: projects who already have at least a proof of concept for
review, limited to 300K ada.\
* Product: proposals with a product already in the market, limited to
750K ada. +
 +
'85each category had distinct tracks to focus the scope of
submissions: +
\
* Cardano Use Cases\
* Cardano Open: Developers\
* Cardano Open: Ecosystem\
* Catalyst Systems Improvements: Discovery\
* Catalyst System Improvements: Development +
 +
Daniel Ribar (Community and Product at Project Catalyst) talked in depth
about Fund11 in a _Cardano with Paul_ interview.footnote:[Cardano
Catalyst Fund 11 is Now Open With Big Changes From Fund 10,
youtu.be/7hKZWYC7YHQ?si=KrShWlibgtAoG5wX\] With the longtime Catalyst
leadership team now voted in for another year to run affairs, the team
clarified that they will apply fund rules. Proposals submitted
incorrectly, in the wrong track or out of scope, will be notified with
guidance on how to come inline, otherwise they risk being withdrawn. +
 +
There is plenty of feedback and suggestions coming from the community.
For example, Santiago Carmuega, of TxPipe, explained his
casefootnote:[@santicarmuega on Fund11 changes,
twitter.com/santicarmuega/status/1730977552519270712?s=46\] for an
alternative parameter that would be more effective than max number of
proposals per team. Small details can have a big impact on a business

== The Age of Voltaire\

 +
CIP 1694footnote:[CIP 1694,
github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP 1694\] was named
after Voltaire'92s year of birth. It is arguably the most important CIP
to date as it is a proposal to bootstrap the _Age of Voltaire_.
Co-authored by Charles Hoskinson, it is the first CIP he has gotten
directly involved with. It'92s clear a lot of thought went into it, and
it'92s intentionally written as a transitional, living document. +
 +
When Cardano was formed, there was a tripartite structure with Emurgo,
Cardano Foundation (CF) and IOG with remits for ecosystem growth,
governance and engineering respectively. It was always the intention to
move to a members-based organization (MBO) that would manage the
bureaucracy of protocol governance. It was hoped originally that the
Swiss-based CF would be this entity but due to limitations with the
stiftungfootnote:[A stiftung is a foundation which exists to give effect
to the stated, non-commercial wishes of its founder, as set out in a
foundation deed and the articles of association (statutes).\] structure,
it was not viable. +
 +
CIP 1694 is the fruit of years of research. IOG have been working on the
idea of a decentralized update system for some time. For example, they
wrote a paper __Updateable Blockchains__footnote:[Ciampi, Karayannidis,
Kiayias and Zindros (2020), 'Updatable Blockchains',
iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/updatable-blockchains/\] with the
European Union, with a Horizon 2020 grant, to explore ways to implement
this vision. +
 +
Early in 2022, IOG and the CF held workshops to hammer out a way forward
for the Voltaire era. The first question was '91What is good
governance?'92. Charles Hoskinson explained in his ScotFest keynote that
the answer was based on three different categories: +
\

[arabic]
. *The idea of representation* '85did you consent to something? There is
direct representation where you personally voted on something, and
*delegated authority* where you hand someone else your vote. In CIP
1694, this role is called a *DRep, a delegated representative*. This
concept was already introduced in a similar form in project Catalyst.
IOG like to plant seeds and telegraph upcoming features. Wisdom comes
from testing and experimenting with ideas in a live environment. IOG has
learnt a lot from 3 years of Catalyst funding rounds. +
\
. Governance needs some notion of rules, usually called a
*constitution*. These are the guardrails that provide some degree of
stability. The exciting thing about a constitution, in a blockchain
setting, is that it can be machine understandable. Formal specifications
can be the blueprints for Cardano, which a computer can understand to
the extent it can integrate with an update system. Once a voting system
is in place, a constitution can be ratified, hashed and embedded into a
transaction. You now have the option to sign a type of '91end user
agreement'92 by signing a transaction. +
\
. *Institutions* are generally a target of decentralization. If we are
'91killing the middleman'92, why would institutions matter?
Institutions, at their best, set standards and provide a review process
from domain experts. Institutions are essential for good governance as
they are the custodians of knowledge and best practices. People can be
biased, sometimes we need objective neutral bodies to provide guidance.
After much consideration, it was decided the most important '91anchor'92
institute would be a *members-based organization (MBO)* which should
operate similar to other open source initiatives like the Linux
Foundation, or the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). +
 +
*Who, or what is the MBO?* +
 +
The MBO is a point of aggregation to bring together all the different
groups: over 3,000 stake pool operators, the Cardano Ambassadors, the
1,300+ projects building on Cardano, open-source projects running on
Cardano (the Node, Mithril, Hydra, dcSpark, TxPipe.io, ogmios.dev, etc),
IOG, CF, Emurgo, all ada holders, etc. The members will own and run the
MBO, staffing the steering committees. The goal of Voltaire is to bring
these moving parts together. As Charles Hoskinson stated in his keynote:
'93IO is not running the show, we haven't been for a long time...'94 +
 +
The vision for the MBO, was outlined by Johnny Nguyen (former Director
of _Project Constellation_ at IOG) at ScotFest: +
\

____
Serve as the aggregation point of the entire Cardano community and its
members. The members-based organization aims to uncover the community's
pains and desires, facilitating the development of strategies to address
them, and attracting firms and individuals with a capacity and the
capability to do so. +

The MBO, which would become known as _Intersect_,footnote:[Intersect
'91Uniting the Cardano Ecosystem'92, intersectmbo.org\] is the anchor
institution for Voltaire, but not the only one. IOG has been steadily
building out its presence in universities all over the globe, as well as
opening the Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics,footnote:[Carnegie

'91Proposal'92 +
 +
The CIP is worthy of a book in its own right, and Hoskinson has often
stated he would like to write a book on governance.footnote:[Charles
Hoskinson - Book about Decentralized Governance,
youtube.com/watch?v=kutZ41J-tTU \] Like all CIPs, CIP 1694 is a living
document which updates and evolves with feedback. While constitutions
have been written before, we are entering uncharted waters as nothing on
this scale has been attempted in the crypto space. Liquid democracy is
not a new concept, but there are few examples of successful
implementations. CIP 1694'92s motivation is to bootstrap the Voltaire
era, to integrate new and existing on-chain and off-chain components to
self-govern the ecosystem. The ultimate goal is to have a governance
layer on top of Cardano that is fully, end-to-end, on-chain. +
 +
*Where we are '96 5 out of 7 system* +
 +
At time of writing, governance transactions (eg. Hard forks, parameter
changes, etc.) require a signature from at least five out of the seven
Cardano governance (Genesis) keys, currently held by the three founding
entities. This process was always intended to be an ephemeral form of
governance as we got through the earlier eras of the roadmap before
Voltaire. There have until now currently been two types of governance
transaction: +
\
____

* Protocol parameter updates using transaction field n'ba6 of the
transaction
bodyfootnote:[github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/blob/8884d921c8c3c6e216a659fca46caf729282058b/eras/babbage/test-suite/cddl-files/babbage.cddl#L56
\]\
* Movements of the treasury and the reserves using Move Instantaneous
Rewards (MIR) certificates +
 +
*Terminology & Concepts* +
 +
The CIP introduces some new terms. First there is a *governance action*
which any ada holder can submit. Three individual groups then vote to
ratify, or drop, the governance action. +
 +
The three groups that form this tricameralfootnote:[Tricameralism is the
practice of having three legislative or parliamentary chambers. It is
contrasted with unicameralism and bicameralism, each of which is far
more common \] legislative body: +
\
* A constitutional committee, \
* DReps (same name but different role to Catalyst dReps).\
* Stake pool operators (SPOs) +
 +
The *constitutional committee* will have a similar role to an upper
house. Continuing the analogy, DReps would make up the lower house.
*Stake Pool Operators* are the same group introduced earlier who run the
nodes that power the network. A *DRep*, or *delegated representative*,
can be any ada holder representing themselves, or other ada holders who
have delegated their voting rights to them. +
 +
DRep delegation will piggyback on the existing stake delegation and
registration mechanisms. Just like when the ada delegated to a pool is
not moved anywhere, ada delegated to a DRep is not transferred anywhere
either. Also like delegated ada, you can choose to re-delegate from DRep
to DRep at any time. +
 +
Ouroboros has been a huge success story, with a large majority of ada
staked making Cardano one of the most decentralized networks. By
leveraging the SPO network, the process gains a passionate Cardano user
group who are educated and qualified to vote on crucial decisions.
Registered DReps are expected to vote on governance actions regularly to
still be considered active. It will be measured using a new parameter
called '91drepActivity'92. Inactive DReps won'92t count towards the
active voting stake, but can become active again by resuming voting. +
 +
The Cardano Constitution will be drafted with as much input from the
community as possible. This Constitution will contain the guardrails,
the shared values, core tenets and guiding principles agreed upon by
stakeholders. In these early days, it will just be a text document with
its hash recorded on-chain. IOG'92s Chief Legal Officer Joel Telpner
joined Charles Hoskinson for a fireside chatfootnote:[ScotFest fireside
chat with Joel Telpner, youtube.com/watch?v=YvTfSx6pv9Y \] at ScotFest
to discuss the challenges of drafting a new constitution. Telpner
described what a constitution is: +
\

____
I think you can actually simplify a constitution and say it's a set of
rules, but it's a set of rules to do what? It does three things. It
establishes how you legislate; it establishes how you administer and
establishes how you adjudicate. It creates this framework for those
three functions. +
 +
Each of the three bodies plays their role in ratifying governance
actions. Roles may vary for each body in different circumstances. For
example, the constitutional committee will always be in one of two
states, either a *normal state*, or a state of *no confidence*. As you
might expect, if it's in a state of no confidence, it cannot participate
in governance actions. It must be replaced before any governance actions
can be enacted. +
 +
The makeup of the initial constitutional committee is not confirmed, but
likely to be the core members of Intersect as well as other community
members and groups. There are two ways to replace the constitutional
committee. If it's in a normal state, the committee itself, along with
the DReps, can both approve a motion to replace the constitutional
committee. The SPOs are not required in this scenario. +
 +
If the constitutional committee is in a state of no confidence, the SPOs
and the DReps can vote to replace it. If it's already in a state of no
confidence, the assumption is the majority want to replace the
constitutional committee. +
 +
The upper house generally has fewer members than the lower house,
however, there is no fixed size (quorum) for the constitutional
committee in CIP 1694. It can vary each time a committee is formed. The
quorum size is the signature threshold, how many committee members need
to sign to ratify something. +
 +
There are *seven different types of governance actions*: +
\
____

[arabic]
. A motion of no confidence in the constitutional committee. \
. Change the members (and/or quorum) of the constitutional committee. \
. Constitution updates \
. Hard Fork initiation\
. Protocol parameter changes\
. Treasury withdrawals (small, medium or large)\
. Information (no effect on-chain, just there for the record) +
 +
As anyone can submit a governance action, there is a *governance
deposit* required to prevent spamming. This deposit is returned once the
governance action is ratified, dropped or expired. Governance actions
will be ratified by on-chain voting, with each of the six types of
governance actions having different ratification requirements based on
some, or all of the following: +
\

* a set quorum votes of the Constitutional committee (ie. one person,
one vote)\
* a set stake-controlled threshold of DReps \
* a set stake-controlled threshold of SPOs +
 +
Governance actions will be checked for ratification on epoch boundaries.
A vote can be a *yes*, a *no* or an *abstain*. An abstaining vote
won'92t count for active voting stake but if you want to change your
vote, you can just vote again and it will supersede your early
'91abstain'92 vote. A governance action'92s progress can be monitored
on-chain and is enacted one epoch after they are ratified. +
 +
There are also two pre-defined DRep options which, once selected, remain
the selected response until you select otherwise: +
\
* If you delegate to *Abstain*, then your stake is actively marked as
not participating in governance. This means your delegated stake will
not be considered to be a part of the active voting stake, but it will
be considered to be registered for the purpose of the incentives.\
* If you delegate to *No Confidence*, then your stake is counted as a
Yes vote on every '91No Confidence'92 action and a No vote on every
other action. Your delegated stake will be considered part of the active
voting stake and also serves as a directly auditable measure of your
confidence in the constitutional committee. +
 +
The DReps will likely be the most active voters. The constitutional
committee is voting most of the time, but not for a no confidence
motion, or if it's a new committee or quorum vote. The upper house is
typically the most powerful, while SPOs sometimes vote only if the
active voting stake threshold isn't met. It might appear the SPOs have
the weakest position in the tricameral body if they vote least often.
However, it is more nuanced than that because the DReps and SPOs can get
rid of the constitutional committee. +
 +
Also remember the SPOs demonstrated another aspect of Cardano'92s
decentralization when they effectively vetoed the original date for the
Vasil hard fork.footnote:[@KtorZ '91delay is good'92,
twitter.com/_KtorZ_/status/1538101313564811265?s=20&t=Kygsq-InxS6AO0XhjFfr8g
\] +
 +
The CIP favors voting by stake over votes per person. One of the most
important aspects of CIP 1694 is the notion of '91one Lovelace, one
vote'92.Voting per person requires some notion of identity verification,
so there is proof someone is who they claim to be. The CIP explains that
a fully decentralized solution for this is currently not possible. With
regulation varying by jurisdiction, it is prudent to steer clear of any
mechanism that can be construed as '91centralized'92 by willfully
ignorant parties. +
 +
That said, the CIP should be open to change in future as decentralized
IDs (DIDs) evolve. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) announced that
Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) is now an official web standard in
summer 2022. IOG Chief Scientist Aggelos Kiayias also inferred they will
inevitably be part of the 4th generation of blockchains.footnote:[First
Principles: Research for the Future, youtu.be/MVuweooiXPI?t=2280 \] More
about Decentralized Identifiers later. +
 +
*Where we are going* +
 +
The current proposal encompasses two new ledger eras. The first era will
be called _Conway_, after the celebrated English mathematician John
Horton Conway. The current plan for the Conway ledger era is to: +
\
* introduce SPO voting for hard forks \
* provide an on-chain mechanism for rotating the governance keys\
* rewire the ledger rules involving governance as outlined in CIP 1694 +
 +

GitHub.footnote:[Ledger team updates,

 +
If CIP 1694 is to be a success, then we should realize the vision laid
out in the _Road to a Polyglot Ecosystem for Cardano_ whiteboard
video.footnote:[Road to a Polyglot Ecosystem for Cardano,
youtube.com/watch?v=skcCg1WaedA \] The governance mechanisms outlined
above would allow for multiple clients, with different dev teams,
different approaches, programming languages and commercial USPs. There
would be no canonicalfootnote:[Canonical, in computer science, is the
standard state or behavior of an attribute. This term is borrowed from
mathematics, where it is used to refer to concepts that are unique
and/or natural. \] client or wallet for Cardano, just certified or
uncertified. IOG have been working on this for some time, writing papers
and building out expertise in formal methods, specifically with
Agda.footnote:[Agda is a dependently typed functional programming
language. Charles Hoskinson referred to it as 'Super Haskell' \] +
 +
The idea would be that interested parties, such as dcSpark, TxPipe and
others, would work with _Intersect_ to maintain the reference
architecture. This non-production code would be put through the CIP
process, before a formal spec, in Agda, is drafted. This '91Agda core'92
spec enables code extraction to serve as a reference for testing. +
 +
There would no longer be a canonical client of Cardano, just competing
clients written in Rust, Typescript, Python and Haskell. The users would
just be concerned with if it was certified or not. This creates a
healthy '91survival of the fittest'92 marketplace where security is
assured and there is more choice for the end user. +

____
So that's Voltaire '85it'92s deeply philosophical, it's the hardest
thing I've ever done in my life, it's the hardest thing you're ever
going to do in your life and we're going to get it done, because it
needs to get done and I'm damn tired of our industry failing, and it's
about time we can point to something and say '91you know what we did it
the right way'92. We have to tend to our own gardens first. That was a
lesson of Candide. So we have to fix Cardano's governance before we have
the right to complain about any other person's governance. +
 +
Just how hard it would be became evident with some of the initial
skepticism. Some felt governance was not as important as making Cardano
more developer-friendly, or expediting progress on Input Endorsers, for
example. Others just aren'92t turned on by sitting in a room for three
days hammering out the minutiae of a hypothetical vote on a parameter
they'92ve occasionally heard of. While many are too busy, or just not
bothered to participate in governance, there is also the inevitability
that topics like contingent staking would be divisive. +
 +
The issue of contingent staking was the perfect example of how a
proposed feature can be deep divisive. On the foot of the SEC crackdown
on Kraken exchange, Charles Hopkinson muted the idea of contingent
staking.footnote:[Staking and Regulation,
youtube.com/live/J7y2tvpHY5w?feature=share&t=412 \] +
 +
This was not a new idea, it had been proposed years ago. It is the
notion that stake pool operators have the option to approve ada holders
who to stake with their pool. It could be implemented as a multisig
transaction which could include a KYC process. +
 +
Some objectors felt that government(s) could lean on stake pool
operators and force them to blacklist certain users, and that the
proposed feature smacked of censorship. Others for the fear argued the
new functionality would not replace existing configurations but expand
the platform, extending participation to new user groups. +
 +
Hopkinson made several follow up videosfootnote:[Contingent Staking
(Part 2), youtube.com/watch?v=C_a9F0aSUSk\] in response, explaining
contingent staking wouldn't replace traditional staking in any way and
that both worlds can coexist. Contingent staking would not be about
enforcing regulation, but enabling it. +
 +
It was an example of how every issue of governance can be subjective.
How do we even measure success? Many people were interested and engaged
and 2023 saw the Cardano community show up in their droves in the depths
of the coldest Crypto Winter. +
 +
So 2023 would be all about debating how to implement CIP 1694. But first
people needed to be informed. Early discussionsfootnote:[CIP 1694: An
explainer, youtube.com/watch?v=obFeC2JS_IQ&t=5s\] like the one between
Matthias Benkort (Cardano Foundation) and Jared Corduan and Kevin
Hammond (from IOG) were important to ensure there was a clear
understanding of what was being proposed +
 +
The CIP was written in a deliberately high-level, approachable format to
stimulate discussion and feedback. The community did not disappoint with
50 workshops, 30 in-person and 20 online, with over 1000 participants
from 20+ countries.footnote:[Interactive map of 1694 workshops,
cip1694.intersectmbo.org/\] The CIP has had the most feedback (750+
comments) of any CIP with many contributors, some familiar faces, and
some new ones from all corners of the globe, listed in the
'91acknowledgements'92 section of the CIP. +
 +
In addition to community-led workshops, IOG, EMURGO, and the Cardano
Foundation co-hosted three separate governance workshops. The CF
workshop occurred in Zug, Switzerland (CF), in June, followed by Tokyo,
Japan (EMURGO). The Edinburgh workshop in July marked the conclusion of
the CIP 1694 design feedback loop. +
 +
Dozens of blogs have been written, and contentious issues have been
argued over Reddit, Twitter (X) and Telegram. It is not possible to
acknowledge every voice here, but you can dig into the finer detail by
following Nicolas Cerny'92s diary of events on the Cardano
Forum.footnote:[Cardano Governance Updates: Community Input, Voltaire
Phase, and CIP 1694 Updates,
forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-governance-updates-community-input-voltaire-phase-and-CIP
1694-updates/115878\] Some of points that stood out were: +
 +
*Consensus is rarely unanimous* +
 +
Updates to CIP 1694 have led to wrangling among some of the community,
especially the plan to incentivize participation and legitimacy by
freezing the withdrawal of accrued ada staking rewards, which would be
inaccessible until the wallet is delegated to a DRep. While many felt
DReps should be rewarded, or at least comped, for their work, others
argued that there should be no incentives for DReps to do their job, as
it might attract the wrong sort only '91in it for the money'92. The
interim proposal is to escrow Lovelace from the treasury until a way
forward can be agreed, likely using the on-chain governance mechanism
currently under construction. +
 +
Alternative governance mechanisms have been put forward. @HeptaSean
shared his _Minimal Viable Governance_ proposal on the Cardano
Forum.footnote:[Minimal Viable Governance,
forum.cardano.org/t/minimal-viable-governance/115621\] He suggests a
leaner governance framework without a constitution or CC, no DReps, no
SPO votes where every ada holder can directly vote. +
 +
There is also Cardano Problem Statement, CPS-0007,footnote:[CPS 0007 -
Volaire Era Governance, github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/481\]
submitted by Pi Lanningham. The CPS aims '91to frame a set of
motivations, goals, constraints, and open questions for the very broad
topic of Cardano governance'92 to stimulate a wider discussion on
whether there is a viable alternative to CIP 1694. Another useful
contribution was CPS'960006 __Governance Security__footnote:[CPS 0006 -
Governance Security, github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/491\] from
Rick McCracken who also ran several community governance workshop
sessions.footnote:[Governance Security Workshops,
twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1650135262574395392?s=20\] +
 +
In May, the Cardano Foundation conducted a SPO on-chain
poll,footnote:[Entering Voltaire: on-chain poll for SPOs,
cardanofoundation.org/en/news/entering-voltaire-on-chain-poll-for-spos/\]
a new mechanism (defined in CIP-94)footnote:[CIP-0094? | SPO On-chain
Polls #496, github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/496\] to allow stake
pool operators to vote on crucial issues based on the stake delegated to
their pool. The poll is similar to governance action 7 (info) as neither
have a binding effect although '91minPoolCost'92 was subsequently cut to
170 ada. +
 +
The inaugural poll asked '91Which setup would you prefer to be put in
place from Q3 2023 onwards?'92 with 6 options: +
\
____

* Keep k at 500 and minPoolCost at 340 ada.\
* Keep k at 500 and halve minPoolCost to 170 ada.\
* Increase k to 1000 and keep minPoolCost at 340 ada.\
* Increase k to 1000 and halve minPoolCost to 170 ada.\
* I would prefer to abstain.\
* None of the above. +
 +
Not everyone approved of the options in the poll. Some found it strange
that there was no '91MinPoolCost = 0'92 option, while others felt the
question lacked context. With this feedback in mind, there were
discussion threads created on the Cardano Forumfootnote:[Cardano Forum
SPO-Poll threads, forum.cardano.org/tag/spo-poll\] to explore the
options in more detail. +
 +
In an essay titled __Cardano Improvement Proposal '97 1694: Can
Decentralized Communities Make Superior Decisions?__footnote:[Cardano
Improvement Proposal - 1694: Can Decentralized Communities Make Superior
Decisions?,
medium.com/@photrek/cardano-improvement-proposal-1694-ca971194eb20\]
authors Kenric Nelson, Juana Attieh, Megan Hess, Vanessa Cardui, and
Stephen Whitenstall evaluated Cardano'92s shift to a community-led
governance model. The recurring issue of unfair distribution of voting
power reared its head again. The essay warns a system with a
one-coin-one-vote (1c1v) philosophy can result in a
plutocracy,footnote:[A plutocracy is a state or society governed by the
wealthy\] with a small portion of addresses tend to control a
disproportionate amount of voting influence. +
 +
Governance on Cardano hit a milestone on Friday, June 30, 2023 when the
CIP 1694 Pull Request was merged into the main branch of the Cardano
Foundation CIP repository. The proposal'92s status advanced on to the
'91Proposed'92 stage. The update was not unanimously welcomed with some
contributors concernedfootnote:[Reaction to CIP 1694 status update,
github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380#issuecomment-1615285365\]
things were being rushed without other alternative models being explored
sufficiently. Veteran CIP editor Matthias Benkort explained the
reasoning for the merge: +
\

____
It has arguably undergone sufficient conversations, the specification is
well articulated and the rationale pretty furnished as well. Originally,
we wanted to wait for after the final Edinburgh workshop, though with
@JaredCorduan no longer able to continue championing the pull request,
it is better to continue conversations on this CIP in separate pull
requests. It should also help make conversations a bit more manageable
as they can be scoped to specific areas of the CIP. ('85) I'd like to
remind everyone about the goals of the CIP process and what the process
itself stands for. A CIP is NOT binding anyhow, nor is it any kind of
authoritative document that command changes on a project. A CIP is first
and foremost, a technical solution to a problem that is thoroughly
discussed and backed by arguments. +
 +
In any case, SPOs have the final say as they must upgrade their nodes
with any proposed changes. +
 +
The Edinburgh meetup in July was the capstone workshop for all the CIP
1694 feedback to date. Representatives from the in-person workshops held
around the world were invited to discuss and share their insights with
their peers. +

1694 workshop Miro Board, miro.com/app/board/uXjVM7H7URo=/\] set up for
the Edinburgh CIP 1694 workshop +
 +
In a presentation, Kevin Hammond listed six key issues which came up in
all workshops: on-chain deposits, treasury withdrawals, community
tooling, action expiration, action thresholds, and DRep incentives.
There was broad consensus on most topics but some required a specialized
working group to map a way forward. You can follow some of the
discussions on the public Miro board. +
 +
As almost everything in Cardano takes the form of a transaction, getting
the metadata standard correct is critical. Metadata allows developers to
embed information specific to the context of the transaction. For
example, the NFT standard (see CIP-25, CIP-68, CIP-60) on Cardano has
evolved with new capabilities unlocked with past roadmap releases. Pi
Lanningham authored CIP-0100footnote:[CIP-0100? | Governance Metadata,
github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/556\] to clear up what metadata
standards need to be introduced to enable the on-chain governance
mechanisms proposed in CIP 1694. +
 +
CIP-95footnote:[CIP-95, cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0095\] is a crucial
CIP, which extends CIP-30 and describes the interface between
webpage/web-based stacks and Cardano wallets. More specifically, it is a
specification (based on the Draft Conway Ledger Era) that defines the
API of the javascript object that is injected into web applications. The
CIP enables voting capabilities for governance tools. At the Edinburgh
hackathon, decisions were made around open questionsfootnote:[CIP-95,
github.com/Ryun1/CIPs/blob/governance-wallet-connector/CIP-0095/README.md#open-questions\]
and the base design was approved. +
 +
We'92ve only scratched the surface. As governance can be subjective,
it's best you read CIP 1694 yourself, especially the _Rationale_ and
_Changelog_ sections which add context. +
 +
*Cardano Ballot* +
 +
In November, Intersect announcedfootnote:[Cardano Ballot Event on CIP
1694,
intersectmbo.org/news/intersect-announces-cardano-ballot-on-future-governance\]
a community-wide poll to get a '91temperature check'92 on CIP 1694'92s
progress. The vote took place on the Cardano Ballot app developed by the
Cardano Foundation which had been stress-tested on the Cardan Summit
Awards 2022 and 2023. The Cardano Ballot is powered by the open-source
__Wallet Connector__footnote:[Cardano Foundation Wallet Connector,
github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-connect-with-wallet\] developed by
the Cardano Foundation, based on the CIP-30 and CIP-8 standards. It
works with many Cardano wallets but hardware wallets were not supported
due to features missing in the firmware of the hardware wallets.
Vacuumlabs are working on a solution, funded by Catalyst Fund
10.footnote:[Vacuumlabs Fund10 Proposal,
milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1000108\] IOG engineers also
contributed to the ballot event which posed the question: +
 +
Based on the current progress, should we as a Cardano community continue
to develop and deploy minimum viable on-chain governance as described in
CIP 1694, subject to the final approval of the SPOs? +
 +
Participants voted Yes, No, or Abstain and could also include a comment
with their vote. +
 +

text,title="figure 9.12"] +
**Figure 9.12:** Screenshot from 1694ballot.cardano.org/vote +
 +
The poll was non-binding and part of a broader iterative process to
garner community participation and feedback. As usual, the community'92s
response was emphatic. Many felt it would not be a fair reflection of
community sentiment as most people hold their ada on hardware wallets.
Others questioned why existing community tooling was not used. There was
some confusion over the abruptness of this poll suddenly appearing on
their timeline, although it had been muted as far back as the NFTxLV in
September and featured on the Intersect Roadmap.footnote:[Intersect
Roadmap, intersectmbo.org/roadmap\] +
 +
Undeterred, the community found a workaround. _Summon Platform and
DripDropz_ collaborated to offer an alternative CIP 1694 temperature
check.footnote:[Summon Platform Poll, tempcheck.smmn.app/poll\] The poll
itself remained unchanged but people could now vote with hardware
wallets and also review live results. The drama from the initial
'91Twitter storm'92 was short lived and the ballot(s) only served to
demonstrate decentralized governance in practice. +
 +

**Figure 9.13:** Temperature check results +

Nicolas Cerny followed up with some forensic analysis.footnote:[Voltaire
Update: The CIP-1694 Temperature Checks - Insights and Analysis,
forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-governance-updates-community-input-voltaire-phase-and-cip-1694-updates/115878/18#voltaire-update-the-cip-1694-temperature-checks-insights-and-analysis-1\]
He noted some of the possible reasons for the low turnout may have been
the nature of the poll being non-binding, the relatively short notice of
two weeks for the Cardano Ballot event, and many ada holders are just
not interested in participating in the governance process. It will
hopefully serve as a learning experience and the subsequent
open-sourcing of the Cardano Ballot codefootnote:[Cardano Ballot,
github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cardano-ballot\] means anyone can now
initiate their own poll, encouraging more engagement and participation
in future. +

== Intersect\

 +
The much talked about MBO was renamed _Intersect_, as in the
intersection of Cardano and its community, and launched in July after
the Edinburgh workshop. Intersect is an aggregation point for
Cardano'92s community governance and development. It is '91an MBO'92,
not '91the MBO'92...other MBOs will likely follow. +
 +
_Intersect_ will serve as a steward of the underlying blueprints so this
means the code for the Cardano Node, core Cardano libraries and
components moving over from IOG'92s GitHub repos to Intersect repos. It
will be the community'92s town hall for advancing Cardano'92s roadmap.
Grants and work packagesfootnote:[A '91work package'92 is like a
procurement brief capturing the requirements that need vendor support to
deliver. \] will be available for members to apply for.
CH:footnote:[Latest Cardano and Crypto Developments with Charles
Hoskinson, 14 Dec 2023, twitter.com/i/spaces/1YqxoDPoMdaKv\] +
\

____
..there is an open question of what is the next priority? So Intersect
is one of the organs, not the only one, but an organ where that is
discussed from a product to product viewpoint. And the people who serve
in those working groups are basically going to be the ones who start
filling out that product priority'85and the engineers are the ones who
go and execute that, but they execute at the behest of the backlog. +
 +
'85 +
The other thing is it helps us with business intelligence, where we, for
the first time ever as an ecosystem, really need to look at other
ecosystems. I've been trying to do this, like with Sean
Fordfootnote:[IOG appoints W. Sean Ford as CEO of newly created
stablecoin venture,
iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2023/10/23/iog-appoints-w-sean-ford-as-ceo-of-newly-created-stablecoin-venture/\]
coming in from Algorand, and you know Eran (Barak) and others coming in
from the Polkadot ecosystem. But it turns out that other ecosystems do
great work too, and they think differently and sometimes value things
differently, but a lot of that stuff from those other ecosystems could
be of tremendous benefit to Cardano'85 but it has to be harnessed,
translated and captured in the right way. So when you have a bucket like
Intersect what that allows you to do is to not only have Cardno
community members but within those working groups you could have people
from other ecosystems. +
 +
There already exist several institutions where community members share
their expertise to support a specific need or aspect of Cardano. There
is the Cardano DeFi Alliance (CDA)footnote:[Cardano DeFi Alliance,
cardanodefialliance.org/\] which standardizes best practices within the
DeFi ecosystem. The NFT Guildfootnote:[NFT Guild, nft-guild.io/\] which
focuses on developing standards and tooling for the Cardano NFT space.
The UTXO Alliancefootnote:[UTXO Alliance, utxo-alliance.org/\] advocates
interoperability across systems using UTXO-based blockchains. +
Members from these existing groups will amalgamate into the various
Intersect boards, councils, committees and working groups. The goals of
Intersect are distilled in it'92s five pillars: +
\
____

[arabic]
. Support the *community* to develop the ecosystem by hosting
developer-focused conferences, hackathons, and events.\
. Administrate and champion Cardano'92s *community-led governance*
implemented by CIP 1694.\
. Coordinate delivery of the community approved *Cardano Technical
Roadmap*.\
. Coordinate the routine *maintenance* of Cardano for system stability.\
. Coordinate open source *development* of core technologies for
Cardano. +
 +
*Intersect Committees* +
 +
The Parameters Committee meets every few weeks to review Cardano's
parameters encompassing network, technical and economic parameters. The
minutes of these meetings are available on the Cardano
Forum.footnote:[Parameters Committee Updates,
forum.cardano.org/c/governance/parameters-committee-updates/220\] You
can see the consideration that goes into a parameter change by reading
Matthew Capps _Protocol Change Proposal-001, Chronology of Documented
Events_ tweet.footnote:[Matthew Capps, Protocol Change Proposal-001
tweet, twitter.com/cryptstitution/status/1725745468821344432?s=46\] +
 +
An important stream for Intersect is the Cardano Civics Committee (CCC)
which is an advisory committee focussing on off-chain discussions about
governance proposals. It will support the Constitutional Committee and
monitor the governance process to ensure it is working as intended.
Notable members include Adam Ruschfootnote:[Adam Rusch,
twitter.com/AdamRusch\] who holds a PhD in Social Sciences and Marcus
Fysh, British Member of Parliament for Yeovil. +
 +
The Membership, and Community Committee (MCC) fosters community
inclusivity. More committees and working groups will follow in 2024'85 -

\

____
...it's not decentralized governance if it's not by the people, for the
people, run by the people... +
 +
 +
Key to Intersect being a success is the commitment to open-source
development on Cardano. The Open Source Committee (OSC) is the shepherd
for this open-source approach. Without wanting to get lost in
abbreviations, the OSC will act as an advisory body to the Open Source
Program Office within Intersect. The OSC has mapped out the following
tenets: +
\
____

* Maintain the *legitimacy* of the Cardano Open Source Project (COSP)\
* Maintain the (high quality) security and health of the Cardano
mainnet\
* Sustainable Development of the COSP must continue.\
* Be a good Open Source citizen. +
 +
Pat Sheridan, co-founder and CEO of Modus Create, is the interim Chair
for the crucial bootstrapping phase. Michael Peyton Jones created a
first draftfootnote:[Initial draft of governance policy,
github.com/IntersectMBO/community/pull/1\] of the open source governance
policy. The committee is always open to new members. To learn more,
it'92s best to check out the Intersect discordfootnote:[Intersect
discord server, discord.com/invite/Gr7FhzaVrk\] #OSC-feedback channel
for the latest news. +
 +
True open source means having flexibility to choose from different
options. The Cardano Foundation has also been following an Open Source
strategy. Director of Product, Alex Apeldoorn, outlined the suite of
productsfootnote:[Cardano Foundation 2023 Products to Advance
Blockchain,
cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-foundation-2023-products-to-advance-blockchain/\]
released in 2023. Ledger Sync,footnote:[Ledger Synch,

Kupo,footnote:[Kupo, github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo#readme\] and
Ogmiosfootnote:[Ogmios, ogmios.dev/\] all follow open source principles
and make life easier to develop on Cardano. +
 +
We already focussed on Aiken'92s growing adoption. Acknowledging that
Java is still the preferred language for a lot of enterprise developers,
the CF created Ledger Sync and the Identity Wallet in Java as open
source tools with this audience in mind. Ledger Sync puts sequential
blockchain data in a new, more accessible database structure, while the
Identity Wallet is a W3C-compatible mobile wallet for managing
self-sovereign identities across Cardano and other blockchains. The
wallet supports multiple standards, integrating key event receipt
infrastructure (KERI) for interoperability so as to fit a broad range of
use cases and enterprise adoption. +
 +
But wait, there'92s more'85 The _Cardano Ballot_ project, a Fully
functional Merkle Tree in Java / Aiken,footnote:[Merkle Tree

Channels L2 (hydra-java Client)footnote:[hydra-java,

forgetting what we mentioned early about the CF open sourced the rewards
calculation,footnote:[Releasing an open source rewards calculation,
cardanofoundation.org/en/news/releasing-an-open-source-rewards-calculation/\]
in an effort to enable anyone to perform and validate the rewards
calculation in a way that is independent of a single implementation. +
 +
With a strong finish to the year, with multiple launches in December,
the CF is poised to build on this momentum in 2024. As CF engineer
Mateusz Czeladka remarked,footnote:[Mateusz Czeladka post,

[[sanchonet-]]
== SanchoNet \

 +
There are a lot of tools to be built in order for CIP 1694 to become a
reality. We naturally need a testbed for this journey. Also to come out
of the Edinburgh meetup in July '9123 was
_SanchoNet_,footnote:[SanchoNet, sancho.network/\] a testnet for people
to try out new tools and mechanisms related to CIP 1694. +
 +
SanchoNet was named after the character Sancho Panza, Don Quixote'92s
companion in Miguel de Cervantes'92 literary classic. SanchoNet is
ultimately about transforming an aspirational digital
__Barataria__footnote:[Barataria was a fictional island awarded to
Sancho Panza as a prank in Part II of Cervantes' novel Don Quixote\]
into on-chain governance reality on Cardano mainnet. Note SanchoNet is
not another (ITN) incentivized testnet but a testnet where test-ada is
used to stress test experimental features. +
 +
First introduced to the community in Edinburgh, SanchoNet was rolled out
in 6 phases with each Cardano Node (cardano-cli) release enabling new
governance capabilities. As it'92s fast moving and it'92s best to check
for the latest updates on IOG'92s Discord server in the dedicated
SanchoNet channel.footnote:[SanchoNet discord channel,
discord.com/channels/826816523368005654/1128361520514994178\] +

text,title="figure 9.14"] +
**Figure 9.14**: SanchoNet roadmap +
 +
Although limited to stake pool operators at the command line initially,
the next phase started once the tools were in place for DRep to
register, receive delegation and vote. Test-ada holders could also now
participate by submitting governance actions. There are plenty of areas
where developers can contribute, with tooling required for wallet
integrations, DRep explorers to visualize blockchain data, governance
dashboards, etc. SanchoNet follows its own independent development
roadmap scoped with a technical, rather than governance focus. +
 +
The community stepped up as it always does. Mike Hornan,footnote:[Mike
Hornan, twitter.com/Hornan7\] SPO of '91able'92 stake pool, led the way
contributing cardano-cli cheat sheets, infographics, hosting workshops
and recording YouTube tutorials.footnote:[Mike Hornan SanchoNet
tutorials, youtube.com/@hancoeur/videos\] Adam Deanfootnote:[Adam Dean,
twitter.com/adamKDean\] maintained the testnet,
Blockfrostfootnote:[Blockfrost, twitter.com/blockfrost_io\] provided API
access to SanchoNet. CIP editor Ryan Williamsfootnote:[Ryan Williams,
github.com/Ryun1\] hosted biweekly '91sancho-wallets'92 open hours on
Discord to discuss SanchoNet news and CIP-95 progress. Emurgo released a
Serialization Libraryfootnote:[Serialization converts the state of an
object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse process.\] for
the Conway ledger era. The libraryfootnote:[Emurgo Cardano Serialization
Library, github.com/Emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib\] can be used to
generate new certificates and transactions that can be submitted to
SanchoNet. Many others contributed with dozens of SPOs signed up running
the SanchoNet network. Although there are different roadmap eras and
separate engineering streams, almost everything overlaps in Cardano and
so it'92s no surprise the Mithril team have been busy testing on
SanchoNet also.footnote:[Mithril on SanchoNet,
github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/1173\] +
 +
*GovTool* +
 +
GovTool was first demoed at September's NFTxLV eventfootnote:[NFTxLV,
nftxlv.com/\] and is available for testing at sanchogov.tools. As this
is new tool and process for most users, there is comprehensive
documentation including a testing '91to do'92 list.footnote:[GovTool
documentation, docs.sanchogov.tools/about/sancho-govtool-testing\]
Governance tooling follows an open source model in that it is owned and
maintained by the community. Intersect committees and working groups
hosting and maintaining tooling. +
 +
You can still use the cardano-cli if you prefer, but now there is also
the user-friendly GovTool UI which allows a broader base of ada holders
to test governance features available in SanchoNet. +
 +
We are currently deep in the weeds of Phase 5, with the focus on more
technical functionality testing and building network resilience. Ada
holders could now propose and endorse parameter updates. The final Phase
6 will focus on the governance actions related to hard fork
initiation. +
 +
If 2023 was the year we talked about governance, 2024 will be about
implementation. The consultation period for the constitution will come
into focus, guided by the Cardano Civics Committee (CCC). Then there is
the milestone that will be the Chang hard fork. The Constitutional
Convention is set for late 2024 in Buenos Aires, Argentina which will
capture the feedback from the Constitution Global Workshop Series. The
year will climax with the '91moment of truth'92 when an on-chain vote to
ratify the constitution will take place. CH at 2023 Dubai

Currently Catalyst is the only mechanism upon which we access the
cardano treasury'85well that's great, but that's like saying you have a
garden hose to access your water from the tank'85 it's very small
throughput, there's a lot of water in the tank ... the Cardano treasury
has a lot of funds in it, but not a lot of it gets emitted out '85and
that was by design, because we had to wait for a governance system to be
in place. Now that there's a governance system in place, technically
speaking CIP 1694 would allow the community to open up the treasury for
things that aren't related to Catalyst. +
 +
So in practice you'd have to treat it like a government'85 and what a
government does, they have budget '85little pie chart right you have
slices in the pie '85you have your slice for development, and your slice
for marketing, and your slice for bureaucracy, and you know your slice
for you know buying an island somewhere'85 or whatever the hell you guys
want to do'85.but you have to draw the pie '85and you have to decide how
big of a pie is that going to be? Is it $50 million? Is it $100 million?
So one of the biggest governance challenges actually next year is going
to be how do we, as a community, come together, and decide on an annual
budget for how much resource funds should be actually spent out of the
Cardano treasury? +
