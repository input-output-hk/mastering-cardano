== Governance on Cardano     


A full chapter has been written for 'Cardano for the masses' (up to date Jan 2024) which can serve as starting point for 'Mastering Cardano' governance chapter, but adjusted based on different guidelines and Voltaire updates in the coming months.

It is available here in CFTM repo as an .md file,
https://github.com/johnnygreeney/CardanoForTheMasses/blob/main/Chapter-9-Voltaire.md

...I will update and reformat here as .adoc next

Chapter currently under review, shared by SMEs:
